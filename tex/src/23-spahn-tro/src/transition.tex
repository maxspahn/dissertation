The earlier presented implementation of \acl{mpc} demonstrated its capability to
generate whole-body trajectories for a mobile manipulator efficiently. Employing
free-space decomposition on individual robot links effectively curtailed
computational costs. However, the simplification of collision avoidance to free
spaces resulted in conservative behavior, ultimately constraining the robot's
capabilities. Furthermore, solving the optimization problem remained
computationally expensive, limiting control frequency and yielding non-smooth
trajectories. Consequently, this dissertation marks a decisive shift away from
optimization-based methods towards a geometric approach known as geometric
fabrics. This method allows the encoding of trajectory generation in ordinary
differential equations of second order, presenting an alternative that addresses
the aforementioned limitations. Although geometric fabrics have proven
applicable to real-time trajectory generation, their scope has historically been
limited to dynamic environments, lacking integration with global path planning.
This chapter introduces the concept of \acl{df} to overcome these limitations.
Moreover, extensive comparisons between \ac{mpc} and \acl{sf} are conducted to
substantiate the effectiveness of geometric encoding in trajectory generation.
Finally, real-world experiments are conducted, involving both the manipulator
and the mobile manipulator, to validate the proposed methodologies.
