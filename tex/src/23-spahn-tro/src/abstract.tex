Optimization fabrics are a geometric approach to real-time local
motion generation, where motions are designed by the composition
of several differential equations that exhibit a desired motion behavior.
We generalize this framework to dynamic scenarios and non\hyp{}holonomic robots
and prove that fundamental properties can be conserved. We show that convergence to
desired trajectories and avoidance of moving obstacles can be guaranteed using
simple construction rules of the components. Additionally, we present the
first quantitative comparisons between optimization fabrics and
model predictive control and show that optimization fabrics can generate
similar trajectories with better scalability, and thus, much
higher replanning frequency (up to 500 Hz with a 7 degrees of
freedom robotic arm). Finally, we present empirical results on
several robots, including a non\hyp{}holonomic mobile manipulator with 10
degrees of freedom and avoidance of a moving human,
supporting the theoretical findings.
