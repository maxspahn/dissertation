\subsection{Experiment 4: Nonholonomic robots}%
\label{sub:experiment_4_nonholonomic_robots}

\paragraph{Simulation}
This experiment assesses the performance of the proposed method to compute
trajectories for non\hyp{}holonomic robots with fabrics. Specifically, we run
experiments for a \textit{Clearpath Boxer} for position. As
for the first experiment, we compare the performance to \ac{mpc}. In this
experiment, the initial position, the goal location, and the position of five
obstacles were randomized. The results reveal that our extension of
optimization fabrics to non\hyp{}holonomic robots maintains similar results as with
a robotic arm. Specifically, computational time can be reduced to
optimization-based methods while maintaining good performance in terms of
safety and goal-reaching, \cref{fig:experiment4_simBoxer}. We can also observe
that success rate with \ac{sf} is lower compare to \ac{mpc} due to a high
number of unreached goals.

    Similar performance in terms of safety and goal-reaching can be combined with very
    fast computation using optimization fabrics.
