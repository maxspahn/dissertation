\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces several approaches to surpass explicit environment
representations, employing three distinct implicit representations within the
\ac{fabrics} framework. The study demonstrates that these techniques notably
reduce demands and constraints on perception pipelines, while maintaining a low
computational load on the planner. Consequently, the proposed methods enable the
application of analogous strategies in both dynamic and static environments.
The outcomes underline the successful integration of numerical gradients,
frequently accessible in trained models, into the symbolic implementation of
\ac{fabrics} detailed in \cite{Spahn2022}. Future endeavors should concentrate
on incorporating more implicit robot representations as outlined in
\cite{Liu2022regularized,Koptev2023neural} into this framework. While this work refrains from
delving into dynamic environmental dynamics, an exploration of the potential
synergies between the implicit representations introduced here and the findings
from \cite{Spahn2022} is a promising avenue for investigation.
