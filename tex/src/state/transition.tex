In the previous chapter, we have defined \ac{tg} as the problem of finding a
sequence of actions that will transform the robot from its current state to a
desired state. As this thesis focuses on \ac{tg} for mobile manipulation,
relevant literature must therefore include works from different fields, ranging
from autonomous driving and mobile robotics to manipulation. Besides, \ac{tg} in
dynamic environments generally includes path planning and local \ac{tg}.
Therefore, this chapter summarizes approaches to path planning an local \ac{tg}
from the above mentioned fields.
