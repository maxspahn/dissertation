\begin{abstract}
In the previous chapter, we have defined \ac{tg} as the problem of finding a
sequence of actions that will move the robot from its current state to a
desired state. As this thesis focuses on \ac{tg} for mobile manipulation,
relevant literature must therefore include works from different fields, ranging
from autonomous driving and mobile robotics to manipulation. Besides, \ac{tg} in
dynamic environments generally includes path planning and local \ac{tg}.
Therefore, this chapter summarizes approaches ordered on a scale of reactivity,
that is the frequency at which trajectories are computed. Starting with
controller-like \ac{tg} methods, we then move in order of increasing
time-horizon up until global path planning. At last, we
recall environmental representations for \ac{tg}.
