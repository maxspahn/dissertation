\begin{abstract}
Having laid out the motivation for this thesis, we now
proceed to present the background knowledge required to
understand the contributions of this thesis. After the
introduction of some general notations, we recall the
\acl{mpc} framework in a general time-discrete setting.
Then, we state relevant concepts of differential geometry
that are required in the aim of understanding
\acl{fabrics}. This will lead to the formal introduction of
\acl{fabrics} which is the main topic of this thesis. For
an experienced reader, this chapter, or parts of it, may
be skipped.
