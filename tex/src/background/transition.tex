Having laid out the motivation for this thesis, we now proceed to present the
background knowledge required to understand the contributions of this thesis.
Firstly, we introduce notations used throughout thesis. After the introduction
of some general notations, we recall the \ac{mpc} framework in a general
time-discrete setting.
Then, we state relevant concepts of differential geometry that are
required in the aim of understanding \ac{fabrics}. This will lead us the formal
introduction of \ac{fabrics} which is the main topic of this thesis.
For an experienced reader, this chapter, or parts of it, may be skipped.
