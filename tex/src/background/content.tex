This thesis is concerned with motion planning for robots
with a special focus on mobile manipulators.
Motion planning is a fundamental problem that
aims at finding feasible trajectories between an initial
state and a goal state amidst changing
environments. Importantly, the goal state might be defined in a
task specific way. For example, the goal state might be
defined in the task space (e.g., the end-effector position)
or in the configuration space (e.g., the joint position).
That places motion planning between task planning and control.

To relate this definition of motion planning to the literature,
it can be further split into global path planning and
\ac{tg}. The former is the process of
computing a collision-free path from the initial to the
goal state, while the latter is the process of computing a
smooth trajectory that follows the path as closely as
possible while satisfying the robot's kinematic and dynamic
constraints ~\cite{Rickert2014}. In this thesis, we often
evaluate methods for \ac{tg} without the need for a global
path planner. Instead of following a global path, the
\ac{tg} is then defined by the initial and goal state.
We use \textit{policy} as a general term to refer to 
a method that generates actions at each time step and thus
solves the \ac{tg} problem.

Modern research in robotics is increasingly focusing on
robots that operate in dynamic environments. However,
\textit{dynamic environments} is a broad term that can refer
to environments with a variety of different characteristics.
In this thesis, we define a dynamic environment as an
environment in which the robot's task is, generally, not
known prior to deployment. In contrast to structured
environments, such as production lines, those dynamic
environments are semi-structured or even completely
unstructured. These may contain moving obstacles, such as
other robots, humans, or other unpredictable objects.
Besides, goal configurations, such as goal locations, the
size and shape of manipulation objects, may vary during
deployment. Examples of such environments are supermarkets,
hospitals, or homes, see \cref{fig:dynamic_environments}.

\section{Notations} % (fold)
\label{sec:notations}

Throughout this thesis, vectors are denoted in bold lowercase
letters, $\vec{x}$, matrices in capital, $\mat{M}$, and sets
in calligraphic uppercase, $\mathcal{M}$. In the context of
discrete-time systems, we denote the time step using a
subscript, e.g., $\vx_k$ is the state at time $k$. The
transpose of a matrix is denoted by a superscript $^T$, 
the inverse by a superscript $^{-1}$, and the pseudo-inverse by a
superscript $^{\dagger}$. Partial derivatives are denoted by 
$\der{\vx}{\vy}$ in text block, or more explicitly as
\[\derf{\vx}{\vy}.\]
 $\norm{\vx}_M = \vx^TM\vx$
denotes the weighted squared norm. 


We denote $\q\in\Q\subset\Rn$ a configuration of the robot
with $n$ its degrees of freedom; \Q{} is the configuration
space of the generalized coordinates of the system.
Generally, $\q(t)$ defines the robot's configuration at time
$t$, so that \qdot{}, \qddot{} define the instantaneous time
derivatives of the robot's configuration. Similarly, we
assume that there is a set of task variables
$\xj\in\Xj\subset\Rmj$ with variable dimension $m_j \leq n$.
The task manifold \Xj{} defines an arbitrary manifold of the
configuration space \Q{} in which a robotic task can be
represented. Further, we assume that there is a smooth differential
map $\map_j:\Rn\rightarrow\Rmj$ that relates the
configuration space to the $j^{th}$ task space. For example,
when a task variable is defined as the end-effector
position, then $\map_j$ is the positional part of the
forward kinematics. Conversely,
if a task variable is
defined to be the joint position, then $\map_j$ is the
identity function. In the following, we drop the subscript
$j$ in most cases for readability when the context is clear.

In this work, we assume that \map{} is twice
differentiable so that the Jacobian is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \J = \derf{\q}{\map} \in \mathcal{R}^{m\times n}, 
\end{equation}
or $\J = \der{\q}{\map}$ for short.
Thus, we can write the total time derivatives of \x{} as
\begin{align}
  \xdot &= \J\qdot \\
  \xddot &= \J\qddot + \Jdot\qdot.
\end{align}

\section{Model Predictive Control} % (fold)
\label{sec:model_predictive_control}

Optimization methods, such as dynamic programming are
popular when addressing \ac{tg} problems that are
characterized by multiple equality and inequality
constraints. 
The optimization problem is composed of a cost function, 
a dynamic model of the system, and a set of constraints.
%
This thesis uses exclusively discrete time dynamics, such
that the dynamics of the system are given by 
\begin{equation}
  \z_{k+1} = f(\z_k, \u_k),
\end{equation}
where $\z_k \in \Rn$, $\u_k \in \Rm$ are the state and
control input vectors, respectively. 

Multiple objectives of the \ac{tg} problem are combined in
the cost function:
\begin{equation}
  J(\z,\u) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} J_k(\z_k, \u_k) + J_f(\z_N,\u_N),
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the prediction horizon, and $J_k$ and $J_f$ are
the stage and terminal cost, respectively.

The general \ac{mpc} problem is then formulated as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\u} \quad & J(\z,\u) \\
    \text{subject to} \quad & \z_{k+1} = f(\z_k, \u_k), \quad k=0,\ldots,N-1 \\
    & g(\z_k, \u_k) \leq 0, \quad k=0,\ldots,N-1 \\
    & \z_k \in \Z, \quad \u_k \in \U, \quad k=0,\ldots,N \\
    & \z_0 = \z_{\textrm{init}},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\z_0$ is the initial state, $\Z$ and $\U$ are the
admissible sets of states and control inputs, respectively.
Inequality constraints are denoted by $g(\z_k, \u_k)$.

At each time step, the \ac{mpc} problem is solved to
find the sequence of control inputs $\u_k^*$ that minimize
the cost function. The first control input of the optimal
sequence is then applied to the system.
The subsequent actions in the sequence are used as the
initial guess for the next timestep. 
This process is usually referred to as
receding horizon control \cite{howard2010receding}.

\section{Differential Geometry} % (fold)
\label{sec:differential_geometry}

In this section, we consciously use a simplified formalism
for differential geometry to facilitate its understanding
For a more thorough introduction to differential
geometry, we refer to
~\cite{bullo2019geometric,lee2012smooth,boumal2023introduction,lang2012fundamentals}.

Differential geometry is the study of geometry using calculus.
It is a mathematical discipline that uses the techniques of
differential and integral calculus, as well as linear
algebra, to study problems in geometry. In the context of
this thesis, we recall some of the basic concepts of
differential geometry that are required to understand the
formalism of \acl{fabrics}.

\subsection{Manifolds} % (fold)
\label{sub:manifolds}

A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles
Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, a manifold
is a topological space $M$ such that for each point $p\in
M$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ that is
homeomorphic to an open subset of $\Rn$. The dimension of
the manifold is the dimension of the Euclidean space to
which it is locally homeomorphic.

A smooth manifold is a manifold that is equipped with a
smooth structure. A smooth structure is a collection of
charts that cover the manifold and are compatible with each
other. A chart is a homeomorphism from an open subset of the
manifold to an open subset of $\Rn$. The compatibility
condition is that the transition maps between overlapping
charts are smooth. A smooth map between two smooth manifolds
is a map that is smooth in the sense that it is smooth in
each chart.

\section{Optimization Fabrics} % (fold)
\label{sec:optimization_fabrics}

In this section, we introduce the concept of \acf{fabrics}
which are a framework for \ac{tg}
that is based on the theory of differential
geometry. The main idea is to design \ac{tg} as a
second-order dynamical system. The trajectory generator is
defined by the differential equations, as we will lay out in
the following.

\subsection{Spectral Semi-Sprays} % (fold)
\label{sub:spectral_semi_sprays}

Let us first define the base class for all that follows.
Let $\X$ be a smooth manifold for which we denote vectors as 
$\x\in\X$ and $\xdot\in T\X$ the tangent space of $\X$.

Then, a \textit{spectral semi-spray}~\cite{Ratliff2020} is a
second-order dynamical of the form $\M\xddot + \f = 0$,
where $\M(\x,\xdot)$ and $\f(\x,\xdot)$ are functions of
position and velocity. Besides, \M{} is symmetric and
invertible. We often denote \textit{specs} using the shorter
notation $\Spec = \spec$, where we drop the subscript when
the space of the task variable is clear from the context.
Then the trajectory is defined as the solution to the system
$\xddot=-\M^{-1}\f$.

% subsection spectral_semi_sprays (end)

\subsection{Operations on Specs} % (fold)
\label{sub:operations_on_specs}

On \textit{specs}, we can define two fundamental operations:
the \textit{summation} and the \textit{pullback}.

Given two specs $\Spec_1 = {\left(\M_1,\f_1\right)}_{\X}$ and
$\Spec_2 = {\left(\M_2,\f_2\right)}_{\X}$, their sum is
defined as
\begin{equation}
  \Spec_1 + \Spec_2 = {\left(\M_1 + \M_2, \f_1 + \f_2\right)}_{\X}.
  \label{eq:summation}
\end{equation}

Given a differential map $\map: \Q\rightarrow\X$ and a spec
\spec{}, the \textit{pullback} is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \pull{\map}{\spec} = {\left(\Jt\M\J, \Jt(\f+\M\Jdot\qdot)\right)}_{Q}.
  \label{eq:pullback}
\end{equation}

The pullback allows converting between two distinct
manifolds (e.g. a spec could be defined in the robot's
workspace and being pulled into the robot's configuration
space using the pullback with \map{} being the forward
kinematics).

\subsection{Optimization fabrics}%
\label{sub:optimization_fabrics}

As \ac{fabrics} form a special class of specs, they
inherit their properties, specifically the previously
defined operations of \textit{summation} and
\textit{pullback}. First, let us introduce a finite and
differentiable potential function $\forc(\x)$ defined in a
task manifold \X{}. Then, the modified spec $\Spec_{\forc} =
\left(\M,\f + \der{\x}{\forc}\right)$ is called the
\textit{forced variant} of $\Spec = \spec$. Only if the
trajectory $\x(t)$ generated by the forced spec converges to
the minimum of \forc{}, the spec is said to form an
\textit{optimization fabric}. When the spec only converges
to the minimum when equipped with a damping term,
$\left(\M,\f + \der{\x}{\forc} + \mat{B}\xdot\right)$, it
forms a \textit{frictionless fabric}~\cite[Definition
4.4]{Ratliff2020}. Note that the mechanical system of a
pendulum forms a frictionless fabric, as it optimizes the
potential function defined by gravity when being damped
(i.e., it eventually comes to rest at the configuration with
minimal potential energy).

In the following, methods to construct \ac{fabrics} are
summarized.

\subsection{Conservative fabrics and energization}%
\label{sub:conservative_fabrics_and_energization}

While the previous subsection defined what criteria are required for a spec to form
an \ac{fabric}, the theory on conservative fabrics and energization 
offers a simple way of generating such special specs. As a full summary of the theory
on \ac{fabrics} and their construction is out of scope here, this
subsection only provides an outline of the theory and the reader is referred to 
\cite{Ratliff2021,Wyk2022} for detailed derivations.

In the context of \ac{fabrics}, the term \textit{energy} describes a scalar quantity that
changes as the system evolves over time.  Although this quantity has a physical meaning in
natural systems (e.g., kinetic energy), it can be
arbitrarily defined for \ac{tg}.
Besides, this quantity can be used as
a Lyapunov function to prove the convergence of the trajectory to the minimum of the potential
function.
Generally, specs and \ac{fabrics} do not conserve an energy, but when they do, we
call them \textit{conservative specs}.  A stationary Lagrangian~\cite[Definition
4.11]{Ratliff2020} is one definition for an energy for which the corresponding spec, known
as the Lagrangian spec $\Spec_{\le} = \left(\Me,\fe\right)$, is obtained by applying the
Euler-Lagrange equations. Importantly, Lagrangian specs conserve energy and do thus belong
to the class of \textit{conservative specs}.  It was proven that an unbiased
(\cite[Definition~4.11]{Ratliff2020}) Lagrangian spec forms a frictionless
fabric~\cite[Proposition~4.18]{Ratliff2020}. Such
\ac{fabrics} are analogously called
\textit{conservative fabrics}.  There are two classes of conservative fabrics: Lagrangian
fabrics (i.e., the defining energy is a Lagrangian) and the more specific subclass of
Finsler fabrics (i.e., the
defining energy is a Finsler structure~\cite[Definition 5.4]{Ratliff2020}). 
\begin{definition}
  A Finsler structure is a stationary Lagrangian \lg{} with
  the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Positivity: $\lg>0 \quad \forall \xdot\neq0$,
    \item Homogeneity of degree $1$ in velocity: $\lg(\x,\alpha\xdot) = \alpha\lg(\x,\xdot)$,
    \item For the energy $\le = \frac{1}{2}\lg^2$, the
      tensor $\dertwo{\xdot\xdot}{\le}$ is everywhere
      invertible.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


The operation of \textit{energization} transforms a given differential equation into
a conservative spec.
Specifically, given an unbiased energy Lagrangian \le{} with boundary conforming
\Me{}~\cite[Definition~4.6]{Ratliff2020} and
lower bounded energy $\he = \der{\xdot}{\le}^T\xdot - \le$,
an unbiased spec in normalized,
i.e. $\vec{h} = \inv{\M}\f$,
form $\Spec_{\vec{h}} = (\mat{I},\vec{h})$
is transformed into a frictionless fabric using energization as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  S_{\vec{h}}^{\le} &= \text{energize}_{\le}\{S_{\vec{h}}\} \\
    &= (\Me, \fe + \Pe[\Me\vec{h} - \fe]), 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Pe = \Me\left(\Me^{-1} - \frac{\xdot\xdot^T}{\xdot^T\Me\xdot}\right)$ is an
orthogonal projector.
Energized specs maintain the energy of the Lagrangian and generally change
the trajectory of the underlying spec $\Spec_{\vec{h}}$.
However, if 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Spec_{\vec{h}} = (\mat{I},\vec{h})$ is homogeneous of degree 2,
    \begin{equation}\vec{h}(\x, \alpha\xdot) = \alpha^2\vec{h}(\x, \xdot)\label{eq:homogeneous}\end{equation}
    and
  \item the energizing Lagrangian is a Finsler structure, 
\end{enumerate}
the resulting energized spec forms a frictionless fabric for which the trajectory matches
the original trajectory of $\Spec_{\vec{h}}$. We refer to energized fabrics with that
property as \textit{geometric fabrics}. Geometric fabrics form the building blocks for
\ac{tg} with \ac{fabrics}.
Practically, energization equips the individual components of the planning problem
with a metric when being combined with other components.


\subsection{Trajectory generation using optimization fabrics}%
\label{sub:trajectory_generation_using_optimization_fabrics}

After this brief introduction to the theory of \ac{fabrics},
we can lay out the general procedure for \ac{tg} with the
framework.
When using \ac{fabrics} for \ac{tg}, all
components including constraints and goal attraction are
designed as second order differential equations. If specific
design rules for these equations are respected, all
components can be combined to form a converging trajectory
generator. Specifically, the following steps are performed:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Design path\hyp{}consistent geometries in suited manifolds of the configuration space
    (\cref{eq:homogeneous}).
  \item Design corresponding Finsler energies defining the importance metric in this manifold
    (\cref{sub:conservative_fabrics_and_energization}).
  \item Energize all geometries with the associated Finsler energies 
    (\cref{sub:conservative_fabrics_and_energization}).
  \item Pull back the energized systems into the configuration space and sum them 
    (\cref{sub:operations_on_specs}).
  \item Force the combined system with a differentiable potential. As a composition of optimization fabrics, 
    the resulting trajectory converges towards the potential's minimum
    (\cref{sub:optimization_fabrics}).
\end{enumerate}

This procedure has been initial presented in
\cite{Ratliff2020} and is used throughout this thesis to
generate trajectories with \ac{fabrics}. In \cref{cha:tro_23},
we adopt the procedure to our generalization to dynamic
settings.

Although important concepts and findings on \ac{fabrics} were summarized in this
section, we refer to~\cite{Ratliff2020} for a more in-depth presentation of
\ac{fabrics}. In the following, we generalize the framework of
\ac{fabricss} to dynamic settings.

\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:background_conclusion}

In this chapter, we formalized the environments in which we
want to deploy the presented methods. Then, the problem of
\ac{tg} was placed between task planning and control.
Afterward, we formalized a vanilla \ac{mpc} formulation for
time-discrete systems. Finally, we recalled the required
concepts from differential geometry and introduced the
framework of \ac{fabrics} for \ac{tg}.
