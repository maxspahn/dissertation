Now that we have delved into the crucial literature and established foundational
notations and concepts for trajectory generation, this chapter involves
the application of \acl{mpc} to a mobile manipulator.
Although \ac{mpc} has found application in various domains such as autonomous
driving, drone navigation, and manipulator control, its implementation for
mobile manipulators has been hindered by the curse of dimensionality. This
chapter introduces an environment representation tailored for \ac{mpc},
demonstrating robustness and scalability with an increasing number of obstacles.
Unlike the conventional approach of encoding each obstacle as a constraint in
the optimization problem, we opt for a polygonal representation delineating the
free space around the robot, thereby confining constraints to a fixed number.
Additionally, a method for circumventing moving obstacles with mobile
manipulators is devised through whole-body control, also referred to as
coupled motion. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated through
simulation and substantiated by real-world experiments.
