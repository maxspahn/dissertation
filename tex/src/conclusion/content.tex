\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

% Reference back to introduction
This thesis was stated in the context of labor shortage in the global North and
the need for further automation to combat demographic change. In particular, we
focused on the problem of \ac{tg} for mobile manipulators in human-shared
environments. This thesis proposed several \ac{tg} methods to allow the
deployment of mobile manipulators outside their classical cages.
% Summary of the contributions
The core methods are centered around a
geometric interpretation of \ac{tg} for
manipulators and mobile manipulators. Specifically, we extended the framework of
\ac{fabrics} to more dynamic environments, proposed a symbolic implementation to
allow for fast parameter tuning at runtime, and demonstrated its effectiveness
in a real demonstration case. Along the way, we showed how \ac{mpc} can be used
for mobile manipulators and why geometric approaches tend to outperform
optimization-based methods for these systems. All results were validated
extensively in simulation and verified in real-world experiments. In the
following, we summarize the main contributions of this thesis.

\subsection{MPC for mobile manipulators}
\label{sec:conclusion_mpc}

\cref{cha:icra_21} applied the widely used method of \ac{fsd} to mobile
manipulators which led to several improvements. First, it allowed to control
the system in a coupled way reducing overall execution time, similar to what had
been done in \cite{Avanzini2018} with dynamic weighing. Second, it reduced the
required accuracy of the perception pipeline as raw point clouds or occupancy
grids can be used. Third, we showed that computationally scaling in the number
of obstacles can be prevented. In \cref{cha:tro_23},
we additionally showed that geometric approaches tend to outperform \ac{mpc}
formulations despite weaker theoretical guarantees.

\subsection{Dynamic fabrics}
\label{sec:conclusion_dynamic_fabrics}

\cref{cha:tro_23} generalized the framework of \ac{fabrics} to dynamic
environments. We showed that \ac{fabrics} can be formulated on moving reference
frames, in such a way that trajectory following and collision avoidance with
dynamic obstacles can be combined with other, static components to the \ac{tg}
problem. Specifically, the \textit{dynamic pull-back}
operator brings a dynamically defined component into the static manifold of the
configuration space while making the motion of the frame a runtime variable of
the root geometry. This chapter showed that reference velocity integration is
required to handle moving obstacles. Additionally, integration of global path
planning in arbitrary manifolds is possible to the generalization. In
particular, this chapter proved that convergence to reference paths can be 
guaranteed. Finally, this chapter presented results on path following with a
mobile manipulator and collision avoidance with moving humans in the workspace.
Additionally, we provided a required extension to
\ac{fabrics} for non-holonomic systems, such as differential
drive robots.

\subsection{Symbolic fabrics}
\label{sec:conclusion_symbolic_fabrics}

\cref{cha:icra_23} highlighted the existence of a
closed-form solution to \ac{tg} when formulated as a geometric problem.
This property is exploited in a purely symbolic implementation of \ac{fabrics}
which allows for solver times around 1ms. This chapter additionally
proposed to use a Bayesian optimization to tune parameters
for \ac{fabrics}.
The experiments showed that expert-level can be reached within 50 iterations.
Additionally, the results revealed that parameter sets can be transferred between
similar embodiments. Finally, qualitative results on a real robot are presented
confirming the applicability to both manipulation and mobile
manipulation.

\subsection{Implicit environment representations}
\label{sec:conclusion_implicit}

\subsection{Real-world demonstration}
\label{sec:conclusion_real_world}

\cref{cha:rss_24} demonstrated that \ac{fabrics} are not a mere theoretical
framework but can be used in real-world manipulation demos. In the combination
with a modern decision-making framework, and state-of-the-art perception, 
we demonstrated how \ac{fabrics} can be used to generate trajectories in complex
environments with high-dimensional robots. Besides, it was shown that different
paradigms from \ac{tg} in manipulation, such as learning-based methods and
redundancy resolution, can be easily integrated into the framework.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

This thesis focused on different methods for \ac{tg} that are capable to
generate motion for mobile manipulators in human-shared environments. That
included the adaption to the widely used method of \ac{mpc}
to whole-body control for mobile
manipulators. The main part of this thesis was dedicated to a geometric
interpretation of \ac{tg}. Although several advancements for bringing mobile
manipulators to human-shared environments were made, we acknowledge
that seeing robots in our daily lives will still be a rare sight for the years
to come. In the following, we discuss the limitations of the proposed methods
and highlight important missing pieces to unlock the full potential of mobile
manipulators in human-shared environments.

\subsection{Fabrics or MPC?}
\label{sec:discussion_fabrics_or_mpc}

Most readers are likely familiar with \acl{mpc}, fewer may have seen its application
to, for example, autonomous driving or mobile manipulation, and some 
experienced roboticist may be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of
\ac{mpc}. In contrast, few readers have heard of \ac{fabrics} before and are 
quick to make a connection between both methods, because
\ac{mpc} is based on an \textit{optimization} which is part
of the name of \acf{fabrics}
However, the methods are
fundamentally different,
and it is important to analyze the differences and similarities between
these methods in an understandable way.
% MPC
\ac{mpc} is centered around the
formulation of a constrained optimization problem. The constraints are
the dynamics of the system and avoidance behaviors, such as collision avoidance
or joint limit avoidance. The problem is solved up to a defined optimality 
criteria. In general, the optimization problem is non-linear and non-convex.
% fabrics
In contrast, \ac{fabrics} is a purely geometric method. It is based on the
formulation of a smooth manifold in the configuration space of the robot.
Then, the solution to the \ac{tg} problem is solution to the geodesic equation
where the manifolds metric is non-Riemannian in general. Importantly, the entire
problem is encoded in the metric by iteratively adding avoidance
behaviors, such as collision avoidance or joint limit avoidance. As the
trajectory is as consequence of solving the geodesic equation in each time step, a
closed-form solution is available for explicit behaviors as discussed in this
thesis.
% transition
This fundamentally different view on \ac{tg} has severe implications on
practical implementations.

\paragraph{Reactivity}
\label{par:discussion_reactivity}

One important aspect of \ac{tg} in human-shared environments is the ability to
react fast to changing environments. The \textit{speed} of reaction
of different approaches is captured in what we call
\textit{reactivity} and is uniquely defined by the frequency
at which a \ac{tg} problem can be deployed, which is a
direct consequence of the computational complexity of the
method.

Due to the closed-form solution, computing actions can be
achieved in roughly 1ms for \ac{fabrics} on a 7-DoF
manipulator. Therefore, \ac{fabrics} can arguably be
considered a controller, that captures geometric environment
aspects. In contrast, the solution to the optimization
problem in \ac{mpc} is generally not available in
closed-form. Therefore, the optimization problem has to be 
solved in each time step. Additionally, the problem is
usually non-convex making the solution costly. In numbers,
when encoding the same \ac{tg} problem in an \ac{mpc}
formulation as in \ac{fabrics}, solver times between 10ms
and 100ms are realistic. That substantially reduces
reactivity of the system making it less suitable for fast
changing environments.

\paragraph{Global optimality}
\label{par:discussion_global_optimality}

While reactivity is an important aspect to collision
avoidance in dynamic environments, convergence to the goal
state is equally important when it comes to task success of
manipulation tasks. In \ac{mpc} formulations, future states
are considered when constructing the optimization problem,
thus the evolution and, importantly, goal approaching is
optimized over the entire horizon. In the extreme, an
infinitely long horizon would lead to a globally optimal
solution. This is practically impossible to achieve, such
that the horizon is usually limited to a few stages, and the
remaining stages are approximated by a terminal cost.
Nevertheless, \ac{mpc} formulations practically show strong 
behavior in terms avoidance of local minima. In contrast,
\ac{fabrics} is a purely local method, with no consideration
of future states. It relies purely on the shape of the
manifold to guide the motion. This shape however is not
guaranteed to be free of local minima. In fact, we argued in 
\cref{cha:tro_23} that local minima are likely to occur in
cluttered environments. This is a severe limitation which
must be addressed by either global guidance as we suggested,
or by further analyzes of the generated manifolds.

\paragraph{Motion design}
\label{par:motion_design}

We call \textit{motion design} the process of encoding
behaviors into the \ac{tg} problem. Practically, motion
design describes the 
process for a user to encode different desired behaviors
into the \ac{tg} problem, such that the robot behaves as
indented by the application. In \ac{mpc} formulations,
the behavior is mainly influenced by the objective function
and its weighing factors if multiple objectives are present.
This scalar encoding often proves to be difficult, because
individual objectives are highly coupled. In contrast,
\ac{fabrics} allow for \textit{iterative} motion design.
Specifically, the defining manifold can be iteratively
enhanced, such that individual components can be tested and
tuned separately. For example, in the experiments of this
thesis, we usually defined behaviors in order of
increasing importance, starting with joint limit avoidance
and ending with goal-attraction. That makes the method
user-friendly and individual components exchangeable if an
application might require that. Moreover, individual
behaviors can be quite complex, such as collision avoidance
defined by \ac{sdf} as integrated in \cref{cha:ral_24},
or goal reaching using
deep neural networks, as demonstrated in \cite{xie2023neural}.

In summary, \ac{fabrics} and \ac{mpc} are two fundamentally
different approaches to \ac{tg}. \Ac{mpc} is usually used as
an approximation of the infinite time-horizon optimal
control problem. Using the terminal cost appropriately,
\ac{mpc} formulations lead to reactive behaviors that are
able to avoid local minima up to a certain extent. In
contrast, \ac{fabrics} excels in reactivity and motion
design and should often be regarded as an informed
controller. That comes at the cost of global properties
which must be taken into account when using the method in
cluttered environment. In this thesis, we showed how global
guidance can be integrated using either conventional
path planning or learning-from-demonstration methods.

\subsection{The future of \ac{fabrics}}
\label{sec:discussion_limitations_of_fabrics}

After having discussed differences and similarities between
\ac{mpc} and \ac{fabrics}, we name the core limitations of
our proposed methods and point the reader to potential
future directions of research. 
% continuous time
A practical limitation of \ac{fabrics} --as for any other
geometric method defined in the continuous time domain --
is that the method is not directly applicable to real-world
systems. Specifically, the method has to be discretized and
approximated leading to inaccuracies when tracking continuous
trajectories. A thorough analysis on convergence of the discretization
when applied to real robots is missing to this point.
% tuning
Despite improved design-invariant properties on stability
and convergence compared to \ac{rmp}, the tuning of \ac{fabrics} requires some
intuition that usually comes from experience. We aimed to
tackle that problem in \cref{cha:icra_23}, but further
research should be conducted to simplify the tuning process.
Moreover, all behaviors used in this thesis are
hand-crafted, in \cref{cha:icra_23} up to certain
parameter bounds. Hand-crafting \ac{tg} methods is time-consuming
and does not seem to be the right approach in the long run.
Especially considering the success of learning-based methods
in other fields. Therefore, we argue that \ac{fabrics}
should be seen as a compact, yet rich, encoding of
\ac{tg} that serves only as the building structure for
nuanced, learned behaviors. Be ensuring that deep neural
networks exhibit the properties required by the theory of 
\ac{fabrics}, arbitrarily complex behaviors can be
constructed and importantly combined into a single policy.
This approach has been experienced with in \cite{xie2023neural}
and in \cref{cha:rss_24} of this thesis.
% Geometric algebra
When putting a method into the context of geometric
interpretation, it is natural to ask whether other
mathematical concepts can be applied to the problem.
Recently, the field of geometric algebra has gained 
attention in the robotics community, because it allows
to express different geometric shapes and operations in a
single structure, see \cite{low2023geometric} for example.
While low-order geometric algebras can unify translation and
rotation, higher order geometric algebras can be used to unify
different attractors, as they are required by \ac{fabrics}.
For example, attractors in this thesis are limited to
sets of translations, e.g. an end-effector pose can be
encoded as three translational attractors. Higher order
algebra allow encoding attraction to a circle, line, pose
or sphere as an object of the same algebra \cite{low2023geometric}.
From a conceptional point of view, this seems the more
compact understanding of attractors, and from a practical
point of view, it reduces the amount of parameters required.
Future research in \ac{fabrics} should therefore consider
the integration of higher order geometric algebras.
