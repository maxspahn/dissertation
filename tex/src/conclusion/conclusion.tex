\chapter{Conclusion and discussion}
\label{cha:conclusion_and_discussion}

The final chapter of this thesis summarizes the contributions and discusses the
main results. Besides, research questions for the following years and raised and
potential approaches are layed out. This chapter ends with a vision on the
future of robotics in human-shared environments.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This thesis mainly contributed to geometric interpretation of \ac{tg} for manipulators
and mobile manipulators. Specifically, we extended the framework of \ac{fabrics}
to more dynamic environments, proposed a symbolic implementation to allow for
fast parameter tuning at runtime, and demonstrated its effectiveness in
a real demonstration case. Along the way, we showed how \ac{mpc} can be used for
mobile manipulators and why geometric approaches tend to outperform
optimization-based methods for these systems. All results were validate
extensively in simulation and verified in real-world experiments.
In the following, we summarize the main contributions of this thesis.
