The final chapter of this thesis summarizes the contributions and discusses the
main findings. Then, we provide a qualitative comparison between \ac{fabrics} and
\ac{mpc}. We discuss the limitations of \ac{fabrics} and
propose potential future directions of research.
Specifically, we point the reader to lines of research
that could be integrated to further promote the framework.
Finally, we discuss common questions from the public when
it comes to \ac{tg} and robotics in general. The chapter
is closed by a vision on the future of robotics by the
author.
