The previous chapter introduced \acf{df} as a generalization of \acf{fabrics} to
better cope with dynamic environments for mobile manipulation. Although
theoretically powerful, \ac{fabrics}, and thus also \ac{df}, seem to be
practically hard to tune correctly. This chapter introduces a symbolic
formulation of \ac{fabrics} to reduce the computational costs at runtime and
simplify parameter tuning during execution. We implement a Bayesian parameter
tuning method, similar to hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, to reach
expert-lever performance. We show the effectiveness in real-world experiments
and across different robot embodiments.
