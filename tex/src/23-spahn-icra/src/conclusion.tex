We formulated parameter tuning for trajectory generation as a constrained
optimization problem. Additionally, we introduced symbolic optimization fabrics
that implement optimization fabrics in a parameterized way, for which the
general structure is pre-solved. The trajectory generator obtained with this
technique is parameterized and achieves low computational costs at runtime. We
showed that parameter tuning for symbolic optimization fabrics can be
effectively solved using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we have shown
that the tuning generalized across different robots, tasks, and between
simulation and the real world. Finally, we qualitatively demonstrated that the
method applies to mobile manipulators. 
While we aim at developing a method-agnostic autotuning framework for motion
generation, symbolic optimization fabrics were selected as an example in 
this work.
