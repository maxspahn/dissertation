\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
%
In this paper, we first recall very briefly the theory of optimization fabrics and the steps
to use it for trajectory generation (\cref{sec:optimization_fabrics}). Then, we formulate 
optimization fabrics as a symbolic trajectory generator, so that combining
of individual components is only performed once (\cref{sec:symbolic_fabrics}).
Then, we formulate parameter tuning for trajectory generation as a constrained optimization problem
and propose Bayesian optimization for effective autotuning (\cref{sec:tuning}).  
As an example, we apply this autotuning to symbolic optimization
fabrics (\cref{sec:icra23_experimental_results}), but it is generally 
independent of the trajectory generator at hand.
