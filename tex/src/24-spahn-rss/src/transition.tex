In the previous chapters on \ac{fabrics}, we have suggested suggested a
generalization to the theory in the context of dynamic environments, and
proposed a purely symbolic implementation to simpfily automated parameter
tuning. This chapter highlights that the theory on \ac{fabrics} is not only 
theoretical powerful, but also practically realizable. For automated order
picking in retail environments, we deploy \ac{fabrics} as the main motion
planner. Insights fro visual servoing and learning from demonstration are
integrated to further highlight the general character of the theory. This
chapter was part of a joint work, that would not have been possible without the
contributions of the co-authors, that developed the decision making and
perception algorithms, together with a large engineering effort.
