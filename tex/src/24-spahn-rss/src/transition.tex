In the previous chapters on \ac{fabrics}, we have suggested a
generalization of the theory in the context of dynamic environments, and
proposed a symbolic implementation to simplify automated parameter
tuning. This chapter highlights that the theory on \ac{fabrics} is not only 
theoretically powerful, but also practically realizable. For automated order
picking in retail environments, we deploy \ac{fabrics} as the main \ac{tg}
method. Insights from visual servoing and learning-from-demonstration are
integrated to further highlight the general character of the theory.
