\section{Introduction}

%\MW{We need still an appealing and convincing introduction. I think this is the best part for you to write. While doing this, you might want to look at the following section and remove all the repetitions in there.}


Ageing has started to impact the labour markets profoundly, and robotic labour shortage relief is becoming a necessity in all industries~\cite{mcgrath2021report,astrov2021economies}. Yet, there are still surprisingly few robots operating outside of structured environments. To bring robots successfully to human-occupied environments, the main challenge still is handling human-instilled disturbances~\cite{rodriguez2021human}, e.g., misplaced products in shelves, newly added products, blocked aisles, or interactions from humans. Such disturbances should be handled adaptively, with little development effort and short response times for natural effective interaction. 
Focusing on these challenges, this paper demonstrates a combination of two novel methods, one for adaptive decision making and one for rapid motion planning, embedded in a state-of-the-art integrated robot system. 

The demonstrator is a mobile manipulator for order picking in realistic supermarkets, see \cref{fig:layouts}. %In the following, we explain how this demonstrator is rooted in a real need. 
The increase in online shopping  induces an equal decrease in store visits. Especially in dense urban areas, these costly but conveniently located stores could have a dual use as distribution centres for flash delivery of online orders \cite{kronmuller2023online}. This requires the order picking to occur during opening hours, amongst store customers. We have taken this as our demonstrator scenario, but the methods are generally applicable for any scenario involving human-disturbed mobile manipulation tasks. In such scenarios, we assume that humans can block the robot's path, physically push or hold the manipulator, and move the pick-able items, before, during, or after a pick. Even if items are taken away from the robot's suction gripper, it should recover by picking another item of the same product. % of the same kind.

%Although the realization of such an %application is deemed simple
% To deploy autonomous robots in supermarkets with success, their operation in a
% human-shared environment must be safe, 
% fault-tolerant, and adaptive.
This work presents our mobile manipulation solution
in human-shared environments that aims at being adaptive and fault-tolerant. %Doing so, 
We focus on three main questions that are most 
relevant when deploying robots in supermarkets: How can we

\begin{enumerate}
  \item generate \emph{safe} and \emph{robust} trajectories for manipulation? % (safety, robustness)? %be robust, safe and easy to adapt by
  %non-experts (ease-of-use)?
  \item ensure \emph{fault-tolerant} task planning and execution? % (fault-tolerance)? 
  \item easily \emph{adapt} the robot to pick new products? % (adaptability)?
  %data-driven item detection be extended quickly (extendability)?
\end{enumerate}
Our solution addresses these questions with specific decisions on the robot's capabilities for decision-making, trajectory generation, and perception. Our contributions are thus an integrated system with adaptive decision-making, fast motion planning and easy-to-use teaching from demonstration.
