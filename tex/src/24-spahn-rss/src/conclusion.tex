\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this DEMO-paper, we present our approach to order-picking in human-shared
retail environments. In contrast to previous approaches for that application
\cite{toyota2023}, we deploy a failure-robust task-planning method that can
recover from failure of the individual sub-modules and propose a way to simplify
the `programming' of the robot by leveraging teaching. We show that a
significantly simpler robot design than \cite{toyota2023} can be successful at
the task of in-store order-picking. The approach was evaluated in a realistic store environment
and in a lab-like environments without much modifications. In the future, we
must address the challenge of interacting with more complex-shaped items, such
as fruits and vegetables. That requires the integration of either a gripper
switching method or a more intricate gripper design, as suggested in
\cite{toyota2023}.
