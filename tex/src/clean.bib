{Popov2017,

This paper proposes different strategies and guidelines to obtain useful learning algorithms in the context of robotic manipulation.

The goal of this work is to sucessfully stack lego-bricks. The algorithm is built on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). To reduce the computational costs, a bias-injection is proposed to faster learn complex tasks.

Policy Search has trouble due to scaling

{Karaman2011,

Sampling based algorithms are developped because other methods, such as potential field and decomposotion methods, suffer from the requirement for an explicit representation of the obstacles and high complexity when the degrees of freedom are increased or the number of obstacles get bigger. These algorithms are probabalistically complete.
Stating that PRM is a multiple query methods whereas RRT is a single query algorithm. This allows the latter to be executed online!
Several methods to optimizing a found solution by an RRT run are recalled.

An overview and analysis of several algorithms is given, basically limited to PRM and RRT variants.

The paper focuses on path planning problems but could be extended to planning in configuration space.

Three new algorithms are presented, RRT*, RRG, PRM* that are asymtpotically optimal.},

-Noise state estimation requires keeping track of mean and variance
-Experiences are costly but simulation use (often simplified) models
-Reward shaping

Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
states, actions and rewards.
Learning means to find the relation between all three of them.
Problem in robotics : state and action spaces are usually large and even continuous

Finite horizon is often most relevant.
Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off
-{\textgreater} off-policy vs on-policy

Markov property: a state contains all information of the past-{\textgreater} generally not true in robotics!
Rewards are either a function of state, state+action, state+action+futureState
-{\textgreater} if Markov property does not hold -{\textgreater} no theoretical gurantees

Goals of Reinforcement Learning

Cost Function over finiet Time horizon vs.
Cost Function over infinite Time Horizon with discount factor gamma

Bias Optimal: optimal long term behavior and optimal prefix (transient phase).

Average Reward Setting
idea: equal reward for all time steps on the horizon
-{\textgreater} doesn't require hyperparameter discount

The optimization problem can either be solved using the primal problem -{\textgreater} policy search
or using the Lagrangian Dual formulation
-{\textgreater} value function based approach},

The proposed Hierarchical Learning Algorithm, HRL4N, is built for mobile manipulators. In the highest level of abstraction, the method needs to find out if the base, arm or both are required for the currently active task. The lower level learns to exectute the chosen task. Opposite to NAMO (navigation among movable objects) which require full knowledge of the environment, the proposed method assumes partial observability through virtual depth images.},

noncooperative dynamic game : Being social maximizes the combined reward.
Social Value Orientation : In order to better predict other vehicles' actions, it is usefull to estimate their SVO. Only being selfish or ulta conservative might not result in the best overall reward. Estimations on SVO are made based on observations using machine learning tequniques
Socially compliant Driving : By observing humans' trajectory, inverse reinforcement learning allows to learn human reward functions. This allows AVs to behave almost like humans.
Estimating Driver Behavior with SVO : The utility function combines rewards for all agents involved in the decision and includes their SVO. 
Measuring and Estimating SVO Online : Assuming other agent to follow the same logic (maximizing utility), it is possible to estimate their SVO.
Game-Theoretic Autonomous Control Policy with SVO: Stackelberg game, the follower maximizes its actions based on the leader's actions. In this paper, a back action u1(u2) is considered resulting in simultanous reasoning.

The goal is to find an optimal path while also looking for the motion on this path. Travel time, efforts and power are considered in the objective function.
The solving methods consists of two steps :
1) real trajectories are mapped and result in trajectory profiles. These trajectories must only respect the geometric constraints. 
2) optimizing using a simple clipping process

{Bresson2019,
The approach taking starts with a globally planned trajectory to a destination. If there is any collision on the path, state candidates around the possible collision point are generated. Each of them is then checked for collision. This is the basic idea behind the effective avoidance combination strategy (EACS). However, the paths are only short lasting since no uncertainty in the agents movement is considered. The proposed method uses ideas of group-forming behaviors in crowds, i.e. humans tend to form groups that follow the same direction when being in crowds. Thus, a clustering to polygons is done. The groups are treated as entities subsequently.

By taking the example of the recharing of a robot and energy cost of given transition between states, 
the linear temporal logic is filled with light. 
There are "pre" and "post" conditions of the state

the (infinite) sequence of transtions that should fill
a certain task (without running out of energy).

Using LTL, motion planning integrates periodically recharching of the mobile manipulators. The method is tested in static environemnts.},

The presented controller tries to follow the path while also avoiding dynamic/static objects it might encounter on the way. 
Objects are modelled by elipsoids and sphers. The controller can be mounted on the robot and reacts in real time, thus allowing autonomous behavior.

The proposed method, LMPCC, outperforms other local planners when used with dynamic and static objects. Used for mobile platforms and for lightly crowded environments. It also works for autonomous cars, which are more complex systems.

{Haddad2009,

In this paper the Random-Profile Approach (RPA) is further extended. There are relativly few trajectory planners considering the dynamics and stability constraints. The stability condition, zero-moment-point (ZMP) is used in this work. 

The objective function combines 
1) Time of travel
2) quadratic averages of actuator efforts and power

Nested-master-slave optimization

There is no online replanning involved. 
Problematic when dealing with dynamic environments.
