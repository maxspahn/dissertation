abstract = {Grasping in cluttered environments is a fundamental but challenging robotic skill. It requires both reasoning about unseen object parts and potential collisions with the manipulator. Most existing data-driven approaches avoid this problem by limiting themselves to top-down planar grasps which is insufficient for many real-world scenarios and greatly limits possible grasps. We present a method that plans 6-DOF grasps for any desired object in a cluttered scene from partial point cloud observations. Our method achieves a grasp success of 80.3{\%}, outperforming baseline approaches by 17.6{\%} and clearing 9 cluttered table scenes (which contain 23 unknown objects and 51 picks in total) on a real robotic platform. By using our learned collision checking module, we can even reason about effective grasp sequences to retrieve objects that are not immediately accessible.

abstract = {Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a family of methods used to teach robots specific tasks. It is used to assist them with the increasing difficulty of performing manipulation tasks in a scalable manner. The state-of-the-art in collaborative robots allows for simple LfD approaches that can handle limited parameter changes of a task. These methods however typically approach the problem from a control perspective and therefore are tied to specific robot platforms. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel motion planning approach that combines the benefits of LfD approaches with generic motion planning that can provide robustness to the planning process as well as scaling task learning both in number of tasks and number of robot platforms. Specifically, it introduces Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) based LfD as initial trajectories for the Stochastic Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP) framework. This allows for successful task execution even when the task parameters and the environment change. Moreover, the proposed approach allows for skill transfer between robots. In this case a task is demonstrated to one robot via kinesthetic teaching and can be successfully executed by a different robot. The proposed approach, coined Guided Stochastic Optimization for Motion Planning (GSTOMP) is evaluated extensively using two different manipulator systems in simulation and in real conditions. Results show that GSTOMP improves task success compared to simple LfD approaches employed by the state-of-the-art collaborative robots. Moreover, it is shown that transferring skills is feasible and with good performance. Finally, the proposed approach is compared against a plethora of state-of-the-art motion planners. The results show that the motion planning performance is comparable or better than the state-of-the-art.},

The gripper speed needs to be selected to ensure that the pick-up operation does not fail due to uncertainties in part pose estimation. This, in turn, affects the mobile base trajectory. This paper presents an active learning based approach to construct a meta-model to estimate the probability of successful part pick-up for a given level of uncertainty in the part pose estimate. Using this model, we present an optimization-based framework to generate time-optimal trajectories that satisfy the given level of success probability threshold for picking-up the part.},

abstract = {We present an incremental method for motion generation in environments with unpredictably moving and initially unknown obstacles. The key to the method is its incremental nature: it locally augments and adapts global motion plans in response to changes in the environment, even if they significantly change the connectivity of the world. The restriction to local changes to a global plan results from the fact that in mobile manipulation, robots can ultimately only rely on their on-board sensors to perceive changes in the world. The proposed method addresses three sub-problems of motion generation with three algorithmic components. The first component reactively adapts plans in response to small, continuous changes. The second augments the plan locally in response to connectivity changes. And the third extracts a global, goal-directed motion from the representation maintained by the first two components. In an experimental evaluation of this method, we show a real-world mobile manipulator executing a whole-body motion task in an initially unknown environment, while incrementally maintaining a plan using only on-board sensors.},

This tradeoff enables the EET planner to outperform state-of-the-art sampling-based planners by up to three orders of magnitude. We show that these considerable speedups apply for a variety of challenging real-world motion planning problems. The performance improvements are achieved by leveraging work space information to continuously adjust the sampling behavior of the planner. When the available information captures the planning problem's inherent structure, the planner's sampler becomes increasingly exploitative. When the available information is less accurate, the planner automatically compensates by increasing local configuration space exploration. We show that active balancing of exploration and exploitation based on workspace information can be a key ingredient to enabling highly efficient motion planning in practical scenarios.},

Minimizing the number of these robots on the shop floor requires that each robot should complete the assigned task in a time-optimal manner and therefore maximize the robot's capacity. In this paper we present a search-based algorithm for generating time-optimal trajectories for picking and transporting parts using a mobile manipulator. The approach is based on a hierarchical search that uses discrete search for planning of the mobile base. The time cost due to the motion of the manipulator for picking up the part is evaluated and integrated with the search state space at the appropriate times. The trajectories generated result in picking up of the part with the manipulator while the mobile base is in motion. The performance of the algorithm is studied for different factory sizes and obstacle densities. This approach enables the mobile manipulator to perform pick and transport operation in a smaller time duration compared to the operation where it stops to pick up the object.},

SCP is a useful tool in obtaining real-time solutions to direct optimal control, but it is unable to adequately model nonlinear dynamics due to the linearization and discretization required. As nonlinear program solvers are not yet functioning in real-time, a tool is needed to bridge the gap between satisfying the nonlinear dynamics and completing execution fast enough to be useful. Two methods are proposed, SCP with nonlinear dynamics correction (SCPn) and modified SCPn (M-SCPn), which mixes SCP and SCPn to reduce runtime and improve algorithmic robustness. Both methods are proven to generate optimal state and control trajectories that satisfy the nonlinear dynamics.

Instead of treating persons as dynamic obstacles that should be avoided, here they are treated as special agents with an expert knowledge on navigating in dynamic scenarios. This work proposes that the robot selects and follows leaders, in order to move along optimal paths, deviate from undetected obstacles, improve navigation in densely populated areas and increase its acceptance by other humans. To accomplish this proposition, two novel approaches are developed in the area of leader selection. In the first, a motion prediction approach is used, to detect candidates that are moving to the same place that the robot is. In the second, a machine learning algorithm is trained with real examples and is used to select the best leader among several candidates. Experiments with a real robot are performed to validate the proposed approaches.},

@article{Rimon1992,
abstract = {We present a new methodology for exact robot motion planning and control that unifies the purely kinematic path planning problem with the lower level feedback controller design. Complete information about the freespace and goal is encoded in the form of a special artificial potential function—a navigation function—that connects the kinematic planning problem with the dynamic execution problem in a provably correct fashion. The navigation function automatically gives rise to a bounded-torque feedback controller for the robot's actuators that guarantees collision-free motion and convergence to the destination from almost all intial free configurations. Since navigation functions exist for any robot and obstacle course, our methodology is completely general in principle. However, this paper is mainly concerned with certain constructive techniques for a particular class of motion planning problems. Specifically, we present a formula for navigation functions that guide a point-mass robot in a generalized sphere world. The simplest member of this family is a space obtained by puncturing a disc by an arbitrary number of smaller disjoint discs representing obstacles. The other spaces are obtained from this model by a suitable coordinate transformation that we show how to build. Our constructions exploit these coordinate transformations to adapt a navigation function on the model space to its more geometrically complicated (but topologically equivalent) instances. The formula that we present admits sphere-worlds of arbitrary dimension and is directly applicable to configuration spaces whose forbidden regions can be modeled by such generalized discs. We have implemented these navigation functions on planar scenarios, and simulation results are provided throughout the paper. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {This thesis studies optimal trajectory generation for robot motion planning. Optimal trajectory generation is formulated as an optimal control problem minimizing an objective function while respecting certain constraints. The Direct Multiple Shooting (DMS) algorithm is used to transcribe the infinite-dimensional continuous time optimal control problem into a finite dimensional Nonlinear Program (NLP). Two different solvers were used to solve the NLP, the first one being the interior point solver IPOPT, the second one being the sequential quadratic programming solver SNOPT. We compare the two NLP solvers as well as different DMS parameters, like number of nodes or the integration scheme in terms of runtime performance. Furthermore, we implemented a replanning scheme for the DMS algorithm in order to enable it to counteract heavy disturbances like moving obstacles online. The replanning scheme was tested using a gazebo simulation for a hydraulic robot arm. A stabilizing controller was implemented using the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (ILQG) algorithm in a model predictive control fashion. Finally, we show that the trajectories obtained by DMS are suitable for execution on real hardware: We present experiments performed on an ABB IRB4600 industrial robot arm.},

abstract = {Enriching the map of the flight environment with semantic knowledge is a common need for several UAV applications. Safety legislations require no-fly zones near crowded areas that can be indicated by semantic annotations on a geometric map. This work proposes an automatic annotation of 3D maps with crowded areas, by projecting 2D annotations that are derived through visual analysis of UAV video frames. To this aim, a fully convolutional neural network is proposed, in order to comply with the computational restrictions of the application, that can effectively distinguish between crowded and non-crowded scenes based on a regularized multiple-loss training method, and provide semantic heatmaps that are projected on the 3D occupancy grid of Octomap. The projection is based on raycasting and leads to polygonal areas that are geo-localized on the map and could be exported in KML format. Initial qualitative evaluation using both synthetic and real world drone scenes, proves the applicability of the method.},

abstract = {A key subproblem in the construction of location-aware systems is the determination of the position of a mobile device. This article describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location-awareness with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-Gaussian signals, noise, and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-Gaussian signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. Our results show that we can localize a stationary device to within 1.5 meters over 80{\%} of the time and track a moving device to within 1 meter over 50{\%} of the time. Both localization and tracking run in real-time. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliably track its location. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {We present a constrained optimization method for multi-robot formation control in dynamic environments, where the robots adjust the parameters of the formation, such as size and three-dimensional orientation, to avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles, and to make progress towards their goal. We describe two variants of the algorithm, one for local motion planning and one for global path planning. The local planner first computes a large obstacle-free convex region in a neighborhood of the robots, embedded in position-time space. Then, the parameters of the formation are optimized therein by solving a constrained optimization, via sequential convex programming. The robots navigate towards the optimized formation with individual controllers that account for their dynamics. The idea is extended to global path planning by sampling convex regions in free position space and connecting them if a transition in formation is possible - computed via the constrained optimization. The path of lowest cost to the goal is then found via graph search. The method applies to ground and aerial vehicles navigating in two- and three-dimensional environments among static and dynamic obstacles, allows for reconfiguration, and is efficient and scalable with the number of robots. In particular, we consider two applications, a team of aerial vehicles navigating in formation, and a small team of mobile manipulators that collaboratively carry an object. The approach is verified in experiments with a team of three mobile manipulators and in simulations with a team of up to sixteen Micro Air Vehicles (quadrotors).},

abstract = {High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final 'stop' condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 $\backslash$mathrm{\{}m{\}}/$\backslash$mathrm{\{}s{\}}.},

A fully autonomous warehouse pick-and-place system requires robust vision that reliably recognizes and locates objects amid cluttered environments, self-occlusions, sensor noise, and a large variety of objects. In this paper we present an approach that leverages multiview RGB-D data and self-supervised, data-driven learning to overcome those difficulties. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 3rd- and 4th-place in the stowing and picking tasks, respectively at APC 2016. In the proposed approach, we segment and label multiple views of a scene with a fully convolutional neural network, and then fit pre-scanned 3D object models to the resulting segmentation to get the 6D object pose. Training a deep neural network for segmentation typically requires a large amount of training data. We propose a self-supervised method to generate a large labeled dataset without tedious manual segmentation. We demonstrate that our system can reliably estimate the 6D pose of objects under a variety of scenarios. All code, data, and benchmarks are available at http://apc.cs.princeton.edu/},

abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are known for their ability to effectively compute paths for high-dimensional robots in relatively short times. The same algorithms, however, are also notorious for poor-quality solution paths, particularly as the dimensionality of the system grows. This work proposes a new probabilistically complete sampling-based algorithm, XXL, specially designed to plan the motions of high-dimensional mobile manipulators and related platforms. Using a novel sampling and connection strategy that guides a set of points mapped on the robot through the workspace, XXL scales to realistic manipulator platforms with dozens of joints by focusing the search of the robot's configuration space to specific degrees of freedom that affect motion in particular portions of the workspace. Simulated planning scenarios with the Robonaut2 platform and planar kinematic chains confirm that XXL exhibits competitive solution times relative to many existing works while obtaining execution-quality solution paths. Solutions from XXL are of comparable quality to cost-aware methods even though XXL does not explicitly optimize over any particular criteria, and are computed in an order of magnitude less time. Furthermore, observations about the performance of sampling-based algorithms on high-dimensional manipulator planning problems are presented that reveal a cautionary tale regarding two popular guiding heuristics used in these algorithms, indicating that a nearly random search may outperform the state-of-the-art when defining such heuristics is known to be difficult.},

abstract = {Autonomous robotic systems are becoming ubiquitous in industrial and urban settings, ranging from warehouse robots such as Amazon's to autonomous cars such as Tesla's. From an abstract standpoint, an autonomous robotic system can be seen as the real-time collaboration of a robotic system (an industrial ma- nipulator, a ground vehicle, an airplane, an underwater vehicle), provided with sensors and actuators, and a decision unit that elaborates the sensory input in order to perceive the environment (e.g., position of obstacles, position of other vehicles, definition of the roadway boundaries) and then decide which actua- tion outputs are suitable to achieve a (set of) desired goal(s). One way to take actuation decisions is via the optimization, over a finite time horizon, of a cost functional that can measure, e.g., the amount of energy required to perform a specific motion. Other examples of cost functional include the path length or the amount of overlap between the safety areas of two autonomous cars. The analytic solution to this kind of (optimal control) problems is easy to find only in really simple cases. In realistic applications, such as when robot models including kinematics, dynamics, and geometric and dynamic constraints are considered, there is the need to resort to numerical methods to compute (ap- proximate) solutions by means of iterative algorithms. This thesis focuses on taking the first steps towards the creation of a toolbox for constrained optimal motion planning for robot manipulators. We fo- cused, in particular, on integrating a software for the efficient computation of the dynamics of robot manipulators with a software for the automatic differentiation of the obtained equations of motions. The dynamics and its derivatives, obtained via automatic differentiation, is then merged with an existing numerical optimal control solver for the solution of feasible, collision free, trajectories. With the obtained software framework, we could then starting exploring the pros and cons of using second order derivatives (the ”Hessian”) in relation to the rate of convergence to a (possibly local) minimum. We were interested to explore, for the special case of existing robot manipulators, if the extra time spent in computing the second derivatives can be compensated by a faster convergence rate. Our findings are reported for the case of a planar 2DOF manipulator and a full 3D 6DOF manipulator (an UR 5 robot model)},

We show this approach can solve a challenging class of pick-place and regrasping problems where the exact geometry of the objects to be handled is unknown. The only information our method requires is: 1) the sensor perception available to the robot at test time; 2) prior knowledge of the general class of objects for which the system was trained.

abstract = {As we aim to control complex systems, use of a simulator in model-based reinforcement learning is becoming more common. However, it has been challenging to overcome the Reality Gap, which comes from nonlinear model bias and susceptibility to disturbance. To address these problems, we propose a novel algorithm that combines data-driven system identification approach (Gaussian Process) with a Differential-Dynamic-Programming-based robust optimal control method (Iterative Linear Quadratic Control). Our algorithm uses the simulator's model as the mean function for a Gaussian Process and learns only the difference between the simulator's prediction and actual observations, making it a natural hybrid of simulation and real-world observation. We show that our approach quickly corrects incorrect models, comes up with robust optimal controllers, and transfers its acquired model knowledge to new tasks efficiently.},

abstract = {A defining feature of sampling-based motion planning is the reliance on an implicit representation of the state space, which is enabled by a set of probing samples. Traditionally, these samples are drawn either probabilistically or deterministically to uniformly cover the state space. Yet, the motion of many robotic systems is often restricted to 'small' regions of the state space, due to e.g. differential constraints or collision-avoidance constraints. To accelerate the planning process, it is thus desirable to devise non-uniform sampling strategies that favor sampling in those regions where an optimal solution might lie. This paper proposes a methodology for nonuniform sampling, whereby a sampling distribution is learned from demonstrations, and then used to bias sampling. The sampling distribution is computed through a conditional variational autoencoder, allowing sample generation from the latent space conditioned on the specific planning problem. This methodology is general, can be used in combination with any sampling-based planner, and can effectively exploit the underlying structure of a planning problem while maintaining the theoretical guarantees of sampling-based approaches. Specifically, on several planning problems, the proposed methodology is shown to effectively learn representations for the relevant regions of the state space, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in terms of success rate and convergence to the optimal cost.},

In uncertain environments, a " conservative" planner may be required but then there may be no feasible solution. In this paper, we use a chance constraint to limit the probability of constraint violation and extend this framework to handle uncertain dynamic obstacles. The approach requires the satisfaction of probabilistic constraints at each time step in order to guarantee probabilistic feasibility. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm, which enjoys the computational benefits of a sampling-based algorithm, is used to develop a real-time probabilistically robust path planner. It incorporates the chance constraint framework to account for uncertainty within the formulation and includes a number of heuristics to improve the algorithm's performance.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the safe navigation of a mobile robot through crowds of dynamic agents with uncertain trajectories. Existing algorithms suffer from the "freezing robot" problem: once the environment surpasses a certain level of complexity, the planner decides that all forward paths are unsafe, and the robot freezes in place (or performs unnecessary maneuvers) to avoid collisions. Since a feasible path typically exists, this behavior is suboptimal. Existing approaches have focused on reducing the predictive uncertainty for individual agents by employing more informed models or heuristically limiting the predictive covariance to prevent this overcautious behavior. In this work, we demonstrate that both the individual prediction and the predictive uncertainty have little to do with the frozen robot problem. Our key insight is that dynamic agents solve the frozen robot problem by engaging in "joint collision avoidance": They cooperatively make room to create feasible trajectories. We develop IGP, a nonparametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Our model naturally captures the non-Markov nature of agent trajectories, as well as their goal-driven navigation. We then show how planning in this model can be efficiently implemented using particle based inference. Lastly, we evaluate our model on a dataset of pedestrians entering and leaving a building, first comparing the model with actual pedestrians, and find that the algorithm either outperforms human pedestrians or performs very similarly to the pedestrians. We also present an experiment where a covariance reduction method results in highly overcautious behavior, while our model performs desirably. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Real-time trajectory planning using model predictive control with constraints is proposed for mobile manipulators. The proposed method employs Quadratic Programming( QP) for optimizing control inputs. The control inputs and outputs are limited corresponding to the required motion and the hardware specifications of the mobile manipulator. The required motion is changed frequently according to the situation and the hardware limitations, concretely the torque, the angular velocity, the mobile base velocity and the acceleration, which are subject to the hardware design. The velocity and acceleration of the tip of the hand depend on the motion required by the user or on the environmental situation, and the required motion has to be changed flexibly. Thus, the mobile manipulator has to possess a high degree of freedom and be able to manage redundant system flexibly under constraints. These issues are solved by using the generalized mobile manipulator model with model predictive controller. In this paper, first, the generalized 2-D mobile Manipulator model is shown. The holonomic and nonholonomic mobile base by changing the constraint of the mobile base output is simulated, and the effectiveness of the mobile manipulator control design is confirmed.

The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot's environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot's high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planni ng problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a real-time motion planning and control design of a robotic arm for human-robot collaborative safety. A novel collision-free motion planning method is proposed not only to keep robot body from colliding with objects but also preserve the execution of robot's original task under the Cartesian constraint of the environment. Multiple KinectV2 depth cameras are utilized to model and track dynamic obstacles (e.g. Humans and objects) inside the robot workspace. Depth images are applied to generate point cloud of segmented objects in the environment. A K-nearest neighbor (KNN) searching algorithm is used to cluster and find the closest point from the obstacle to the robot. Then a Kalman filter is applied to estimate the obstacle position and velocity. For the collision avoidance in collaborative operation, attractive and repulsive potential is generated for robot end effector based on the task specification and obstacle observation. Practical experiments show that the 6-DOF robot arm can effectively avoid an obstacle in a constrained environment and complete the original task.},

For the kinodynamic case with forward propagation of random controls and duration, we only consider in addition mild Lipschitz-continuity conditions.These proofs fill a gap in the study of RRT itself.

abstract = {Most common navigation tasks in human environments require auxiliary arm interactions, e.g. opening doors, pressing buttons and pushing obstacles away. This type of navigation tasks, which we call Interactive Navigation, requires the use of mobile manipulators: mobile bases with manipulation capabilities. Interactive Navigation tasks are usually long-horizon and composed of heterogeneous phases of pure navigation, pure manipulation, and their combination. Using the wrong part of the embodiment is inefficient and hinders progress. We propose HRL4IN, a novel Hierarchical RL architecture for Interactive Navigation tasks. HRL4IN exploits the exploration benefits of HRL over flat RL for long-horizon tasks thanks to temporally extended commitments towards subgoals. Different from other HRL solutions, HRL4IN handles the heterogeneous nature of the Interactive Navigation task by creating subgoals in different spaces in different phases of the task. Moreover, HRL4IN selects different parts of the embodiment to use for each phase, improving energy efficiency. We evaluate HRL4IN against flat PPO and HAC, a state-of-the-art HRL algorithm, on Interactive Navigation in two environments - a 2D grid-world environment and a 3D environment with physics simulation. We show that HRL4IN significantly outperforms its baselines in terms of task performance and energy efficiency. More information is available at https://sites.google.com/view/hrl4in.},

At each time-step the robot is tasked with finding the complete continuous-time trajectory from start to goal. This can be quite difficult; the robot must contend with a potentially high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) trajectory space, uncertainty due to limited sensing capabilities, model inaccuracy, and the stochastic effect of executing actions, and the robot must find the solution in (faster than) real time. To overcome these challenges, we build on recent probabilistic inference approaches to continuous-time localization and mapping and continuous-time motion planning.

In retail settings, semantic maps are labeled maps of stores where each discrete section of shelving is assigned a department label describing the types of products on that shelf. Starting from a metric map of the store, the robot autonomously extracts the shelf boundaries, generates a distance-optimal tour of the store to view every shelf, and follows the tour while avoiding unmapped clutter and moving people. The robot creates a point cloud of the store using the data collected from this tour. We introduce a novel soft-object assignment algorithm to create a virtual map and a dynamic programming algorithm to segment this map. These algorithms use a priori information about the products to boost data from laser and camera sensors in order to recognize and semantically label objects. The primary contribution of this paper is the integration of multiple systems for automated path planning, navigation, object recognition, and semantic mapping.

abstract = {Many algorithms have been proposed that create a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Most methods are aimed at finding a solution. However, for many applications, the path must be of a good quality as well. That is, a path should be short and should keep some amount of minimum clearance to the obstacles. Traveling along such a path reduces the chances of collisions due to the difficulty of measuring and controlling the precise position of the robot. This paper reports a new technique, called Partial shortcut, which decreases the path length. While current methods have difficulties in removing all redundant motions, the technique efficiently removes these motions by interpolating one degree of freedom at a time. Two algorithms are also studied that increase the clearance along paths. The first one is fast but can only deal with rigid, translating bodies. The second algorithm is slower but can handle a broader range of robots, including three-dimensional free-flying and articulated robots, which may reside in arbitrary high-dimensional configuration spaces. A big advantage of these algorithms is that clearance along paths can now be increased efficiently without using complex data structures and algorithms. Finally, we combine the two criteria and show that high-quality paths can be obtained for a broad range of robots. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

The Partial Shurtcut heuristic is introduced to create even shorter path while still avoiding obstacles in the environment.
Better clearance is achieved introducing the W-retraction and C-retraction. The latter results in better results while being slower. It is thought to be improvable by using learning methods.},

abstract = {We would like robots to achieve purposeful manipulation by placing any instance from a category of objects into a desired set of goal states. Existing manipulation pipelines typically specify the desired configuration as a target 6-DOF pose and rely on explicitly estimating the pose of the manipulated objects. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation defined on a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape variation, and specifying a target pose at a category level can be physically infeasible or fail to accomplish the task -- e.g. knowing the pose and size of a coffee mug relative to some canonical mug is not sufficient to successfully hang it on a rack by its handle. Hence we propose a novel formulation of category-level manipulation that uses semantic 3D keypoints as the object representation. This keypoint representation enables a simple and interpretable specification of the manipulation target as geometric costs and constraints on the keypoints, which flexibly generalizes existing pose-based manipulation methods. Using this formulation, we factor the manipulation policy into instance segmentation, 3D keypoint detection, optimization-based robot action planning and local dense-geometry-based action execution. This factorization allows us to leverage advances in these sub-problems and combine them into a general and effective perception-to-action manipulation pipeline. Our pipeline is robust to large intra-category shape variation and topology changes as the keypoint representation ignores task-irrelevant geometric details. Extensive hardware experiments demonstrate our method can reliably accomplish tasks with never-before seen objects in a category, such as placing shoes and mugs with significant shape variation into category level target configurations.},

Incorporation of robot safety into path planning is important not only because of the uncertainties in the robot dynamics during path execution, but also because of the inaccuracies in the geometric modeling of obstacles. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed to find a near-optimal path with a weighted distance-safety criterion by using a variational calculus and dynamic programming (VCDP) method. The algorithm is readily applicable to any factory environment by representing the free workspace as channels. A method for deriving these channels is also proposed. Although it is developed mainly for two-dimensional (2D) problems, our method can be easily extended to a class of three-dimensional (3D) problems.

abstract = {Deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads promises increased efficiency and safety. It requires understanding the intent of human drivers and adapting to their driving styles. Autonomous vehicles must also behave in safe and predictable ways without requiring explicit communication. We integrate tools from social psychology into autonomous-vehicle decision making to quantify and predict the social behavior of other drivers and to behave in a socially compliant way. A key component is Social Value Orientation (SVO), which quantifies the degree of an agent's selfishness or altruism, allowing us to better predict how the agent will interact and cooperate with others. We model interactions between agents as a best-response game wherein each agent negotiates to maximize their own utility. We solve the dynamic game by finding the Nash equilibrium, yielding an online method of predicting multiagent interactions given their SVOs. This approach allows autonomous vehicles to observe human drivers, estimate their SVOs, and generate an autonomous control policy in real time. We demonstrate the capabilities and performance of our algorithm in challenging traffic scenarios: merging lanes and unprotected left turns. We validate our results in simulation and on human driving data from the NGSIM dataset. Our results illustrate how the algorithm's behavior adapts to social preferences of other drivers. By incorporating SVO, we improve autonomous performance and reduce errors in human trajectory predictions by 25{\%}.},

Socially compliant Driving : By observing humans' trajectory, inverse reinforcement learning allows to learn human reward functions. This allows AVs to behave almost like humans.
Estimating Driver Behavior with SVO : The utility function combines rewards for all agents involved in the decision and includes their SVO.

The core of these challenges is a two point boundary value problem, known to be NP-hard. Recently, the distance metric has been approximated using supervised learning, reducing computation time drastically. Previous work on such learning RRTs use direct optimal control to generate the data for supervised learning. This letter proposes to use indirect optimal control instead, because it provides two benefits: it reduces the computational effort to generate the data, and it provides a low-dimensional parametrization of the action space. The latter allows us to learn both the distance metric and the steering input. This eliminates the need for a local planner in learning RRTs. Experimental results on a pendulum swing up show tenfold speed-up in both the offline data generation and the online planning time.},

The updates optimize the likelihood of getting a reward through a variant of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and learning is guaranteed to convergence to a local maximum. We find that the network dynamics are qualitatively similar to transient firing patterns during planning and foraging in the hippocampus of awake behaving rats. The model extends classical attractor models and provides a testable prediction on identifying modulating contextual information. In a real robot arm reaching and obstacle avoidance task the ability to represent multiple task solutions is investigated.

Since MPC inputs are recomputed at every control iteration, it is possible to deal with dynamic and unknown scenarios. A number of motion constraints can also be easily included: Acceleration, velocity and position constraints have been enforced, together with collision avoidance constraints for the mobile base and the arm and field-of-view constraints. Such constraints have been extended over the prediction horizon maintaining a linear-quadratic formulation of the problem.

abstract = {Traditionally, autonomous cars make predictions about other drivers' future trajectories, and plan to stay out of their way. This tends to result in defensive and opaque behaviors. Our key insight is that an autonomous car's actions will actually affect what other cars will do in response, whether the car is aware of it or not. Our thesis is that we can leverage these responses to plan more efficient and communicative behaviors. We model the interaction between an autonomous car and a human driver as a dynamical system, in which the robot's actions have immediate consequences on the state of the car, but also on human actions. We model these consequences by approximating the human as an optimal planner, with a reward function that we acquire through Inverse Reinforcement Learning. When the robot plans with this reward function in this dynamical system, it comes up with actions that purposefully change human state: it merges in front of a human to get them to slow down or to reach its own goal faster; it blocks two lanes to get them to switch to a third lane; or it backs up slightly at an intersection to get them to proceed first. Such behaviors arise from the optimization, without relying on hand-coded signaling strategies and without ever explicitly modeling communication. Our user study results suggest that the robot is indeed capable of eliciting desired changes in human state by planning using this dynamical system.},

abstract = {For solving the singularity problem arising in the control of manipulators, an efficient way is to maximize its manipulability. However, it is challenging to optimize manipulability effectively because it is a nonconvex function to the joint angles of a robotic arm. In addition, the involvement of an inversion operation in the expression of manipulability makes it even hard for timely optimization due to the intensively computational burden for matrix inversion. In this paper, we make progress on real-time manipulability optimization by establishing a dynamic neural network for recurrent calculation of manipulability-maximal control actions for redundant manipulators under physical constraints in an inverse-free manner. By expressing position tracking and matrix inversion as equality constraints, physical limits as inequality constraints, and velocity-level manipulability measure, which is affine to the joint velocities, as the objective function, the manipulability optimization scheme is further formulated as a constrained quadratic program. Then, a dynamic neural network with rigorously provable convergence is constructed to solve such a problem online. Computer simulations are conducted and show that, compared to the existing methods, the proposed scheme can raise the manipulability almost 40{\%} on average, which substantiates the efficacy, accuracy, and superiority of the proposed manipulability optimization scheme.},

These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering.

The proposed method runs in two folds, first fold generates the shortest path between the start position to target position in a priori known cluttered environment, wherein the PRM is used to construct straight-lined path by connecting the intermediate nodes. However, the second fold steps help to convert the sharp corners into the smoothen curves throughout the path. The knowledge based fuzzy control system ensures the smooth turns by adjusting the suitable heading angle, there by correcting the position and orientation of the robots to find local/global targets. The presented methodology has been simulated and tested in various environments. Simulation results justify that, the method is not only capable to find an optimal or near-optimal robot path in complex obstacle present environments while avoiding any dead end situation, but also ensures a good control over robot velocity and smooth turning at the turning junctions. In all the simulation experiments it is found that, the method has shorten the path length by more than 5 percent while smoothening and subsequently navigation time was also reduced appreciably.},

Such a navigation problem requires a method that is able to yield a fast execution time, under constraints on the capacity of the robot and on known/unknown obstacles, and that is sufficiently flexible to deal with errors in the known parts of the environment (unexpected obstacles). Our proposal includes an off-line task-independent preprocessing phase, which is applied just once for a given robot in a given environment. Its purpose is to build, within the known zones, a roadmap of near-time-optimal reference trajectories. The actual execution of the task is an online process that combines reactive navigation with trajectory tracking and that includes smooth transitions between these two modes of navigation. Controllers used are fuzzy-inference systems. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to test the performance of the proposed hybrid approach. Obtained results demonstrate the ability of our proposal to handle unexpected obstacles and to accomplish navigation tasks in relatively complex environments. The results also show that, thanks to its time-optimal-trajectory planning, our proposal is well adapted to emergency tasks as it is able to achieve shorter execution times, compared to other waypoint-navigation methods that rely on optimal-path planning.},

abstract = {We present an incremental method for motion generation in environments with unpredictably moving and initially unknown obstacles. The key to the method is its incremental nature: it locally augments and adapts global motion plans in response to changes in the environment, even if they significantly change the connectivity of the world. The restriction to local changes to a global plan results from the fact that in mobile manipulation, robots can ultimately only rely on their on-board sensors to perceive changes in the world. The proposed method addresses three sub-problems of motion generation with three algorithmic components. The first component reactively adapts plans in response to small, continuous changes. The second augments the plan locally in response to connectivity changes. And the third extracts a global, goal-directed motion from the representation maintained by the first two components. In an experimental evaluation of this method, we show a real-world mobile manipulator executing a whole-body motion task in an initially unknown environment, while incrementally maintaining a plan using only on-board sensors.},

Feedback motion planning creates policies for the entire map prior to employment of the robot. Elastic roadmaps can be employed in dynamic environments.

In elastic roadmaps, edges represent controllers which maintain connectivity as long as possible. The controllers have collision avoidance behaviour so that the vertices can be seen as milestones

This is in contrast to current implemented approaches that are conservative and fold the arm into a fixed home configuration. Our planner first constructs a base roadmap and then for each node in the roadmap it checks for collision status of current manipulator configuration along the edges formed with adjacent nodes, if the current manipulator configuration is in collision, the manipulator C-space is searched for a new reachable configuration such that it is collision-free as the mobile manipulator moves along the edge. We show that HAMP is probabilistically complete.

abstract = {Motion planning deals with finding a collision-free trajectory for a robot from the current position to the desired goal. For a high-dimensional space, sampling-based algorithms are widely used. Different sampling algorithms are used in different environments depending on the nature of the scenario and requirements of the problem. Here, we deal with the problems involving narrow corridors, i.e., in order to reach its destination the robot needs to pass through a region with a small free space. Common samplers used in the Probabilistic Roadmap are the uniform-based sampler, the obstacle-based sampler, maximum clearance-based sampler, and the Gaussian-based sampler. The individual samplers have their own advantages and disadvantages; therefore, in this paper, we propose to create a hybrid sampler that uses a combination of sampling techniques for motion planning. First, the contribution of each sampling technique is deterministically varied to create time efficient roadmaps. However, this approach has a limitation: The sampling strategy cannot adapt as per the changing configuration spaces. To overcome this limitation, the sampling strategy is extended by making the contribution of each sampler adaptive, i.e., the sampling ratios are determined on the basis of the nature of the environment. In this paper, we show that the resultant sampling strategy is better than commonly used sampling strategies in the Probabilistic Roadmap approach.},

Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a range of challenging environments, but the proliferation of algorithms makes it difficult to discern which particular approach would be best suited for a rich, diverse task like grasping. To answer this question, we propose a simulated benchmark for robotic grasping that emphasizes off-policy learning and generalization to unseen objects. Off-policy learning enables utilization of grasping data over a wide variety of objects, and diversity is important to enable the method to generalize to new objects that were not seen during training. We evaluate the benchmark tasks against a variety of Q-function estimation methods, a method previously proposed for robotic grasping with deep neural network models, and a novel approach based on a combination of Monte Carlo return estimation and an off-policy correction. Our results indicate that several simple methods provide a surprisingly strong competitor to popular algorithms such as double Q-learning, and our analysis of stability sheds light on the relative tradeoffs between the algorithms 11Accompanying video: https://goo.gl/pyMd6p.},

abstract = {Autonomous agents optimize the reward function we give them. What they don't know is how hard it is for us to design a reward function that actually captures what we want. When designing the reward, we might think of some specific training scenarios, and make sure that the reward will lead to the right behavior in those scenarios. Inevitably, agents encounter new scenarios (e.g., new types of terrain) where optimizing that same reward may lead to undesired behavior. Our insight is that reward functions are merely observations about what the designer actually wants, and that they should be interpreted in the context in which they were designed. We introduce inverse reward design (IRD) as the problem of inferring the true objective based on the designed reward and the training MDP. We introduce approximate methods for solving IRD problems, and use their solution to plan risk-averse behavior in test MDPs. Empirical results suggest that this approach can help alleviate negative side effects of misspecified reward functions and mitigate reward hacking.},

@article{Cohen2014,
abstract = {Heuristic searches such as the A search are a popular means of finding least-cost plans due to their generality, strong theoretical guarantees on completeness and optimality, simplicity in implementation and consistent behavior. In planning for robotic manipulation, however, these techniques are commonly thought of as impractical due to the high dimensionality of the planning problem. In this paper, we present a heuristic search-based approach to motion planning for manipulation that does deal effectively with the high dimensionality of the problem. Our approach achieves the necessary efficiency by exploiting the following three key principles: (a) representation of the planning problem with what we call a manipulation lattice graph; (b) use of the ARA search which is an anytime heuristic search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality; and (c) use of informative yet fast-to-compute heuristics. The paper presents the approach together with its theoretical properties and shows how to apply it to single-arm and dual-arm motion planning with upright constraints on a PR2 robot operating in non-trivial cluttered spaces. An extensive experimental analysis in both simulation and on a physical PR2 shows that, in terms of runtime, our approach is on a par with other most common sampling-based approaches despite the high dimensionality of the problems. In addition, the experimental analysis shows that due to its deterministic cost minimization, the approach generates motions that are of good quality and are consistent, in other words, the resulting plans tend to be similar for similar tasks. For many problems, the consistency of the generated motions is important as it helps make the actions of the robot more predictable for a human controlling or interacting with the robot. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Three different state-of-the-art humanaware navigation planners were used for planning the robot paths during all selected use-cases. We compare results of simulation experiments with these human-aware planners in terms of quality of generated trajectories together with discussion on capabilities and limitations of the planners. The results show that the human-robot collaborative planner [1] performs better in everyday path-crossing configurations. This suggests that the criteria used by the human-robot collaborative planner (safety, time-to-collision, directional-costs) are possible good measures for designing acceptable human-aware navigation planners. Consequently, we analyze the effects of these social criteria and draw perspectives on future evolution of human-aware navigation planning methods.},

abstract = {Predictive control is an efficient model-based methodology to control complex dynamical systems. In general, it boils down to the resolution at each control cycle of a large nonlinear optimization problem. A critical issue is then to provide a good guess to initialize the nonlinear solver so as to speed up convergence. This is particularly important when disturbances or changes in the environment prevent the use of the trajectory computed at the previous control cycle as initial guess. In this paper, we introduce an original and very efficient solution to automatically build this initial guess. We propose to rely on off-line computation to build an approximation of the optimal trajectories, that can be used on-line to initialize the predictive controller. To that end, we combined the use of sampling-based planning, policy learning with generic representations (such as neural networks), and direct optimal control. We first propose an algorithm to simultaneously build a kinodynamic probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and approximate value function and control policy. This algorithm quickly converges toward an approximation of the optimal state-control trajectories (along with an optimal PRM). Then, we propose two methods to store the optimal trajectories and use them to initialize the predictive controller. We experimentally show that directly storing the state-control trajectories leads the predictive controller to quickly converges (2 to 5 iterations) toward the (global) optimal solution. The results are validated in simulation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and other dynamical systems.},

A key ingredient of the new strategy is the bridge test, which boosts the sampling density inside narrow passages. The bridge test relies on simple tests of local geometry and can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The strengths of the bridge test and uniform sampling complement each other naturally and are combined to generate the final hybrid sampling strategy. Our planner was tested on point robots and articulated robots in planar workspaces.

The specification of the robot is provided in the form of an LTL (Linear Temporal Logic) formula. A trajectory satisfying an LTL formula may contain a loop whose repetitive execution causes the depletion of battery charge in the robot. The motion plan generated by our methodology ensures that the robot visits the charging station periodically in such a way that it never gets depleted with battery charge while carrying out its mission optimally. Given a set of potential charging station locations and an LTL specification, our algorithm also finds the best location for the charging station along with the optimal trajectory for the robot. We encode the motion planning problem as an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) solving problem and use the off-the-shelf SMT solver Z3 to solve the constraints to find the location of the charging station and generate an optimal trajectory for the robot. We apply our methodology to synthesize energy-aware trajectories for robots with different dynamics in various workspaces and for various LTL specifications.},

abstract = {Manipulation planning is the task of computing robot trajectories that move a set of objects to their target configuration while satisfying physically feasibility. In contrast to existing works that assume known object templates, we are interested in manipulation planning for a category of objects with potentially unknown instances and large intra-category shape variation. To achieve it, we need an object representation with which the manipulation planner can reason about both the physical feasibility and desired object configuration, while being generalizable to novel instances. The widely-used pose representation is not suitable, as representing an object with a parameterized transformation from a fixed template cannot capture large intra-category shape variation. Hence, we propose a new hybrid object representation consisting of semantic keypoint and dense geometry (a point cloud or mesh) as the interface between the perception module and motion planner. Leveraging advances in learning-based keypoint detection and shape completion, both dense geometry and keypoints can be perceived from raw sensor input. Using the proposed hybrid object representation, we formulate the manipulation task as a motion planning problem which encodes both the object target configuration and physical feasibility for a category of objects. In this way, many existing manipulation planners can be generalized to categories of objects, and the resulting perception-to-action manipulation pipeline is robust to large intra-category shape variation. Extensive hardware experiments demonstrate our pipeline can produce robot trajectories that accomplish tasks with never-before-seen objects.},

The SFC is a collection of convex overlapping polyhedra that models free space and provides a connected path from the robot to the goal position. We derive an efficient convex decomposition method that builds the SFC from a piece-wise linear skeleton obtained using a fast graph search technique. The SFC provides a set of linear inequality constraints in the QP allowing real-time motion planning. Because the range and field of view of the robot's sensors are limited, we develop a framework of Receding Horizon Planning , which plans trajectories within a finite footprint in the local map, continuously updating the trajectory through a re-planning process. The re-planning process takes between 50 to 300 ms for a large and cluttered map. We show the feasibility of our approach, its completeness and performance, with applications to high-speed flight in both simulated and physical experiments using quadrotors.},

abstract = {In dynamic environments crowded with people, robot motion planning becomes difficult due to the complex and tightly-coupled interactions between agents. Trajectory planning methods, supported by models of typical human behavior and personal space, often produce reasonable behavior. However, they do not account for the future closedloop interactions of other agents with the trajectory being constructed. As a consequence, the trajectories are unable to anticipate cooperative interactions (such as a human yielding), or adverse interactions (such as the robot blocking the way). In this paper, we propose a new method for navigation amongst pedestrians in which the trajectory of the robot is not explicitly planned, but instead, a planning process selects one of a set of closed-loop behaviors whose utility can be predicted through forward simulation. In particular, we extend Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) [1] to this domain using the closed-loop behaviors Go-Solo, Follow-other, and Stop. By dynamically switching between these policies, we show that we can improve the performance of the robot as measured by utility functions that reward task completion and penalize inconvenience to other agents. Our evaluation includes extensive results in simulation and real-world experiments.},

abstract = {Vacuum-based end effectors are widely used in industry and are often preferred over parallel-jaw and multifinger grippers due to their ability to lift objects with a single point of contact. Suction grasp planners often target planar surfaces on point clouds near the estimated centroid of an object. In this paper, we propose a compliant suction contact model that computes the quality of the seal between the suction cup and local target surface and a measure of the ability of the suction grasp to resist an external gravity wrench. To characterize grasps, we estimate robustness to perturbations in end-effector and object pose, material properties, and external wrenches. We analyze grasps across 1,500 3D object models to generate Dex-Net 3.0, a dataset of 2.8 million point clouds, suction grasps, and grasp robustness labels. We use Dex-Net 3.0 to train a Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Network (GQ-CNN) to classify robust suction targets in point clouds containing a single object. We evaluate the resulting system in 350 physical trials on an ABB YuMi fitted with a pneumatic suction gripper. When evaluated on novel objects that we categorize as Basic (prismatic or cylindrical), Typical (more complex geometry), and Adversarial (with few available suction-grasp points) Dex-Net 3.0 achieves success rates of 98{\%}, 82{\%}, and 58{\%} respectively, improving to 81{\%} in the latter case when the training set includes only adversarial objects.

abstract = {Finding feasible, collision-free paths for multiagent systems can be challenging, particularly in non-communicating scenarios where each agent's intent (e.g. goal) is unobservable to the others. In particular, finding time efficient paths often requires anticipating interaction with neighboring agents, the process of which can be computationally prohibitive. This work presents a decentralized multiagent collision avoidance algorithm based on a novel application of deep reinforcement learning, which effectively offloads the online computation (for predicting interaction patterns) to an offline learning procedure. Specifically, the proposed approach develops a value network that encodes the estimated time to the goal given an agent's joint configuration (positions and velocities) with its neighbors. Use of the value network not only admits efficient (i.e., real-time implementable) queries for finding a collision-free velocity vector, but also considers the uncertainty in the other agents' motion. Simulation results show more than 26{\%} improvement in paths quality (i.e., time to reach the goal) when compared with optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), a state-of-the-art collision avoidance strategy.},

abstract = {In both human and humanoid movement science, the topic of movement primitives has become central in understanding the generation of complex motion with high degree-of-freedom bodies. A theory of control, planning, learning, and imitation with movement primitives seems to be crucial in order to reduce the search space during motor learning and achieve a large level of autonomy and flexibility in dynamically changing environments. Movement recognition based on the same representations as used for movement generation, i.e., movement primitives, is equally intimately tied into these research questions. This paper discusses a comprehensive framework for motor control with movement primitives using a recently developed theory of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). DMPs are a formu- lation of movement primitives with autonomous nonlinear differential equations, whose time evolution creates smooth kinematic movement plans. Model-based control theory is used to convert such movement plans into motor commands. By means of coupling terms, online modifications can be incorporated into the time evolution of the differential equations, thus providing a rather flexible and reactive framework for motor planning and execution — indeed, DMPs form complete kinematic control policies, not just a particular desired trajectory. The linear parameterization of DMPs lends itself naturally to supervised learning from demonstrations. Moreover, the temporal, scale, and translation invariance of the differential equations with respect to these parameters provides a useful means for movement recognition. A novel reinforcement learning technique based on natural stochastic policy gradients allows a general approach of improving DMPs by trial and error learning with respect to almost arbitrary optimization criteria, including situations with delayed rewards. We demonstrate the different ingredients of the DMP approach in various examples, involving skill learning from demonstration on the humanoid robot DB and an application of learning simulated biped walking from a demonstrated trajectory, including self-improvement of the movement patterns in the spirit of energy efficiency through resonance tuning.},

abstract = {We present a sampling-based mobile manipulator planner that considers the base pose uncertainty and the effects of this uncertainty on manipulator motions. The overall planner has three distinct and novel features: (i) it uses the Hierarchical and Adaptive Mobile Manipulator Planner (HAMP) that plans for both the base and the arm in a judicious manner; (ii) it uses localization-aware sampling and connection strategies to consider only those nodes and edges which contribute toward better localization; (iii) it incorporates base pose uncertainty along the edges (where arm remains static) and the effects of this uncertainty are considered on arm motion. We call this overall planner HAMP-BUA, where BUA denotes “Base pose Uncertainty and its propagation to Arm motions.” First we evaluate our planner in known static environments and show that it finds a safer path as compared with other variants where uncertainty is not considered at different levels as mentioned above. Next, we incorporate our planner within an integrated and fully autonomous system for mobile pick-and-place tasks in unknown static environments. A key aspect of our integrated system is that the planner works in tandem with base and arm exploration modules that explore the unknown environment. Our system is implemented both in simulation and on the actual Simon Fraser University (SFU) mobile manipulator and we present the corresponding results. It demonstrates a level of competency in exploring unknown environments for carrying out pick-and-place tasks that has not been demonstrated previously.},

This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.},

abstract = {Robotic grasping in cluttered environments is often infeasible due to obstacles preventing possible grasps. Then, pre-grasping manipulation like shifting or pushing an object becomes necessary. We developed an algorithm that can learn, in addition to grasping, to shift objects in such a way that their grasp probability increases. Our research contribution is threefold: First, we present an algorithm for learning the optimal pose of manipulation primitives like clamping or shifting. Second, we learn non-prehensible actions that explicitly increase the grasping probability. Making one skill (shifting) directly dependent on another (grasping) removes the need of sparse rewards, leading to more data-efficient learning. Third, we apply a real-world solution to the industrial task of bin picking, resulting in the ability to empty bins completely. The system is trained in a self-supervised manner with around 25000 grasp and 2500 shift actions. Our robot is able to grasp and file objects with 274 picks per hour. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's ability to generalize to novel objects.},

The approach is based on a hierarchical search that uses discrete search for planning of the mobile base. The time cost due to the motion of the manipulator for picking up the part is evaluated and integrated with the search state space at the appropriate times. The trajectories generated result in picking up of the part with the manipulator while the mobile base is in motion. The performance of the algorithm is studied for different factory sizes and obstacle densities. This approach enables the mobile manipulator to perform pick and transport operation in a smaller time duration compared to the operation where it stops to pick up the object.},

abstract = {Many games have a collection of boards with the difficulty of an instance of the game determined by the starting configuration of the board. Correctly rating the difficulty of the boards is somewhat haphazard and required either a remarkable level of understanding of the game or a good deal of play-testing. In this study we explore evolutionary algorithms as a tool to automatically grade the difficulty of boards for a version of the game sokoban. Mean time-to-solution by an evolutionary algorithm and number of failures to solve a board are used as a surrogate for the difficulty of a board. Initial testing with a simple string-based representation, giving a sequence of moves for the sokoban agent, provided very little signal; it usually failed. Two other representations, based on a reactive linear genetic programming structure called an ISAc list, generated useful hardness-classification information for both hardness surrogates. These two representations differ in that one uses a randomly initialized population of ISAc lists while the other initializes populations with competent agents pre-trained on random collections of sokoban boards. The study encompasses four hardness surrogates: probability-of-failure and mean time-to-solution for each of these two representations. All four are found to generate similar information about board hardness, but probability-of-failure with pre-evolved agents is found to be faster to compute and to have a clearer meaning than the other three board-hardness surrogates. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recent progress in the field of robotic manipulation has generated interest in fully automatic object packing in warehouses. This paper proposes a formulation of the packing problem that is tailored to the automated warehousing domain. Besides minimizing waste space inside a container, the problem requires stability of the object pile during packing and the feasibility of the robot motion executing the placement plans. To address this problem, a set of constraints are formulated, and a constructive packing pipeline is proposed to solve these constraints. The pipeline is able to pack geometrically complex, non-convex objects while satisfying stability and robot packability constraints. In particular, a new 3D positioning heuristic called Heightmap-Minimization heuristic is proposed, and heightmaps are used to speed up the search. Experimental evaluation of the method is conducted with a realistic physical simulator on a dataset of scanned real-world items, demonstrating stable and high-quality packing plans compared with other 3D packing methods.},

In this paper we present two different techniques for coordinated multi-robot teams for searching and tracking people. A probability map (belief) of a target person location is maintained, and to initialize and update it, two methods were implemented and tested: one based on a reinforcement learning algorithm and the other based on a particle filter. The person is tracked if visible, otherwise an exploration is done by making a balance, for each candidate location, between the belief, the distance, and whether close locations are explored by other robots of the team. The validation of the approach was accomplished throughout an extensive set of simulations using up to five agents and a large amount of dynamic obstacles; furthermore, over three hours of real-life experiments with two robots searching and tracking were recorded and analysed.},

abstract = {Motion planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) in dynamic environments is an extensively studied and complex problem. State of the art methods provide approximate solutions that make conservative assumptions to provide safety and feasibility. We aim to outperform current methods by following a trajectory optimization-based approach, providing a Local Model Predictive Contouring Control framework. Our method allows AGVs to execute reactive motion while tracking a locally parametrized reference path, anticipating on the predicted evolution of the environment. Given the static environment configuration in an occupancy grid map and dynamic obstacles represented by ellipses, we formulate explicit collision avoidance constraints. Well-informed planning decisions are made through a cost function with trade-offs between competing performance variables such as tracking accuracy, maintaining the reference velocity, and clearance from obstacles. An efficient implementation of the method is presented that satisfies the real-time constraint of online navigation tasks. Furthermore, we present an implementation of a complete navi- gation system to emphasize our ability to deal with real sensor data and onboard processing. We show that the general definition of the framework applies to both unicycle and bicycle kinematic models, commonly used to represent mobile robots and autonomous cars, respec- tively. Simulation results for a car and experimental results with a mobile robot show that our method is a feasible and scalable approach. Proposed improvements of the method include 1) considering obstacle velocities and positioning with respect to the AGV in the penalty term that creates clearance, 2) incorporating prediction uncertainty of obstacles, and 3) improving our method that deals with infeasible solutions of the optimal control problem.},

abstract = {Sampling-based Motion Planners (SMPs) have become increasingly popular as they provide collision-free path solutions regardless of obstacle geometry in a given environment. However, their computational complexity increases significantly with the dimensionality of the motion planning problem. Adaptive sampling is one of the ways to speed up SMPs by sampling a particular region of a configuration space that is more likely to contain an optimal path solution. Although there are a wide variety of algorithms for adaptive sampling, they rely on hand-crafted heuristics; furthermore, their performance decreases significantly in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present a neural network-based adaptive sampler for motion planning called Deep Sampling-based Motion Planner (DeepSMP). DeepSMP generates samples for SMPs and enhances their overall speed significantly while exhibiting efficient scalability to higher-dimensional problems. DeepSMP's neural architecture comprises of a Contractive AutoEncoder which encodes given workspaces directly from a raw point cloud data, and a Dropout-based stochastic deep feedforward neural network which takes the workspace encoding, start and goal configuration, and iteratively generates feasible samples for SMPs to compute end-to-end collision-free optimal paths. DeepSMP is not only consistently computationally efficient in all tested environments but has also shown remarkable generalization to completely unseen environments. We evaluate DeepSMP on multiple planning problems including planning of a point-mass robot, rigid-body, 6-link robotic manipulator in various 2D and 3D environments. The results show that on average our method is at least 7 times faster in point-mass and rigid-body case and about 28 times faster in 6-link robot case than the existing state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

Sampling based algorithms are developped because other methods, such as potential field and decomposotion methods, suffer from the requirement for an explicit representation of the obstacles and high complexity when the degrees of freedom are increased or the number of obstacles get bigger. These algorithms are probabalistically complete.
Stating that PRM is a multiple query methods whereas RRT is a single query algorithm. This allows the latter to be executed online!
Several methods to optimizing a found solution by an RRT run are recalled.

An overview and analysis of several algorithms is given, basically limited to PRM and RRT variants.

The paper focuses on path planning problems but could be extended to planning in configuration space.

abstract = {To autonomously navigate and plan interactions in real-world environments, robots require the ability to robustly perceive and map complex, unstructured surrounding scenes. Besides building an internal representation of the observed scene geometry, the key insight toward a truly functional understanding of the environment is the usage of higher level entities during mapping, such as individual object instances. This work presents an approach to incrementally build volumetric object-centric maps during online scanning with a localized RGB-D camera. First, a per-frame segmentation scheme combines an unsupervised geometric approach with instance-aware semantic predictions to detect both recognized scene elements as well as previously unseen objects. Next, a data association step tracks the predicted instances across the different frames. Finally, a map integration strategy fuses information about their 3D shape, location, and, if available, semantic class into a global volume. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that the proposed approach for building instance-level semantic maps is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, while additionally able to discover objects of unseen categories. The system is further evaluated within a real-world robotic mapping setup, for which qualitative results highlight the online nature of the method.

This forms the basis for GPMP2, a very efficient algorithm that combines GP representations of trajectories with fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we extend GPMP2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP2, that can efficiently replan when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several sampling-based and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP2 is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We also benchmark iGPMP2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP2 to replan from scratch.},

In RRT, how to select a tree to extend or connect is a critical factor, which will greatly influence the efficiency of path planning. In this paper, a novel learning-based multi-RRTs (LM-RRT) approach is proposed for robot path planning in narrow passages. The LM-RRT approach models the tree selection process as a multi-armed bandit problem and uses a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns action values and selects actions with an improved $\epsilon$-greedy strategy ($\epsilon$t-greedy). Compared with previous RRT algorithms, LM-RRT can not only enhance the local space exploration ability of each tree, but also guarantee the efficiency of global path planning. The probabilistic completeness and combinatory optimality of LM-RRT are proved based on the geometric characteristics of the configuration space.

abstract = {This paper presents a generalization of the classic A∗ algorithm to the domain of sampling-based motion planning. The root assumptions of the A∗ algorithm are examined and reformulated in a manner that enables a direct use of the search strategy as the driving force behind the generation of new samples in a motion graph. Formal analysis is presented to show probabilistic completeness and convergence of the method. This leads to a highly exploitative method which does not sacrifice entropy. Many improvements are presented to this versatile method, most notably, an optimal connection strategy, a bias towards the goal region via an Anytime A∗ heuristic, and balancing of exploration and exploitation on a simulated annealing schedule. Empirical results are presented to assess the proposed method both qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of high-dimensional planning problems. The potential of the proposed methods is apparent, both in terms of reliability and quality of solutions found.},

abstract = {We present a manipulation planning framework that allows robots to plan in the presence of constraints on end-effector pose, as well as other common constraints. The framework has three main components: constraint representation, constraint-satisfaction strategies, and a general planning algorithm. These components come together to create an efficient and probabilistically complete manipulation planning algorithm called the Constrained BiDirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)-CBiRRT2. The underpinning of our framework for pose constraints is our Task Space Regions (TSRs) representation. TSRs are intuitive to specify, can be efficiently sampled, and the distance to a TSR can be evaluated very quickly, making them ideal for sampling-based planning. Most importantly, TSRs are a general representation of pose constraints that can fully describe many practical tasks. For more complex tasks, such as manipulating articulated objects, TSRs can be chained together to create more complex end-effector pose constraints. TSRs can also be intersected, a property that we use to plan with pose uncertainty. We provide a detailed description of our framework, prove probabilistic completeness for our planning approach, and describe several real-world example problems that illustrate the efficiency and versatility of the TSR framework. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2011.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to motion planning using Gaussian processes. In contrast to most existing trajectory optimization algorithms, which rely on a discrete state parameterization in practice, we represent the continuous-time trajectory as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP) generated by a linear time-varying stochastic differential equation. We then provide a gradient-based optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states. We benchmark our algorithm against recent trajectory optimization algorithms by solving 7-DOF robotic arm planning problems in simulation and validate our approach on a real 7-DOF WAM arm.},

abstract = {This work proposes an algorithm besides output feedback linearization method for controlling a wheeled mobile robot with two manipulators. To control such a mobile robot, three desired trajectories (or fixed points for regulation) are needed: two for the arms and one for the base. Improper choice in base path leads to singularity, low performance and failure. To prevent singularities and to attain a smooth motion, an algorithm is introduced as a local path planning process for the base. It consists of two parts which helps the robot to maintain the desired configuration. The first part of the algorithm mainly focuses on the position and orientation of the base in future time based on the arms configuration, and the second part adjusts the movement of the arms for obtaining a consistent motion. This maintenance reduces and preserves the norm of applied torques, which consequently leads to an increase in the performance of the robot and its dynamic load carrying capacity (DLCC). Also, it is no longer required to define a trajectory or an end point for the base movement since they will be calculated automatically by the algorithm.},

The new potential field technique uses diffeomorphic transformations and exploits the resulting point-world topology. The combined approach is applied to the problem of handling deformable material by multiple nonholonomic mobile manipulators in an obstacle environment to yield a centralized coordinating control law.

abstract = {We present an efficient method for addressing online the inversion of differential task kinematics for redundant manipulators, in the presence of hard limits on joint space motion that can never be violated. The proposed Saturation in the Null Space (SNS) algorithm proceeds by successively discarding the use of joints that would exceed their motion bounds when using the minimum norm solution. When processing multiple tasks with priority, the SNS method realizes a preemptive strategy by preserving the correct order of priority in spite of the presence of saturations. In the single- and multitask case, the algorithm automatically integrates a least possible task-scaling procedure, when an original task is found to be unfeasible. The optimality properties of the SNS algorithm are analyzed by considering an associated quadratic programming problem. Its solution leads to a variant of the algorithm, which guarantees optimality even when the basic SNS algorithm does not. Numerically efficient versions of these algorithms are proposed. Their performance allows real-time control of robots executing many prioritized tasks with a large number of hard bounds. Experimental results are reported.},

We use factor graphs and numerical optimization to perform inference quickly, and we show how GP interpolation can further increase the speed of the algorithm. Our framework also allows us to incrementally update the solution of the planning problem to contend with changing conditions. We benchmark our algorithm against several recent trajectory optimization algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that our approach is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the incremental version of our algorithm on replanning problems, and show that it often can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required to replan from scratch.},

However, while instinctive to humans, socially compliant navigation is still difficult to quantify due to the stochasticity in people's behaviors. Existing works are mostly focused on using feature-matching techniques to describe and imitate human paths, but often do not generalize well since the feature values can vary from person to person, and even run to run. This work notes that while it is challenging to directly specify the details of what to do (precise mechanisms of human navigation), it is straightforward to specify what not to do (violations of social norms). Specifically, using deep reinforcement learning, this work develops a time-efficient navigation policy that respects common social norms. The proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a robotic vehicle moving at human walking speed in an environment with many pedestrians.},

For preventing collisions in a real-time fashion the Circular Fields method is a powerful scheme, which we developed further and evaluated extensively. After an initial analysis in rather complex 2D simulations, we extend the evaluation to 3D as well as 6D, where we introduce a hybrid strategy based on Circular and Potential Fields. Finally, the 6D implementation of a hybrid Circular {\&} Potential Fields approach is used to perform the experimental analysis for static multi-object parcours and to avoid a dynamically moving human in a 6D task motion. Based on the algorithms for collision avoidance we also develop and experimentally verify an algorithm for tactile exploration of complex planar 3D wire elements, whose structure is a-priori unknown. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFAC.},

abstract = {In this paper a generic approach to the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) problem is proposed. The approach is based on a probabilistic SLAM algorithm and employs only two portable sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a laser range finder (LRF) to estimate the state and environment of a robot. Scan-matching is applied to compensate for noisy IMU measurements. This approach does not require any robot-specific characteristics, e.g. wheel encoders or kinematic models. In principle, this minimal sensory setup can be mounted on different robot systems without major modifications to the underlying algorithms. The sensory setup with the probabilistic algorithm is tested in real-world experiments on two different kinds of robots: a simple two-wheeled robot and the six-legged hexapod AMOSII. The obtained results indicate a successful implementation of the approach and confirm its generic nature. On both robots, the SLAM problem can be solved with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that must achieve a specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion constraints while avoiding collision with moving obstacles with known trajectories. The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state × time space by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state × time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories. The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state × time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state × time space satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small, fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the physical world.},

abstract = {Abstract—In this paper, we address the problem of extracting a feasible set of dynamic parameters characterizing the dynamics of a robot manipulator. We start by identifying through an ordi- nary least squares approach the dynamic coefficients that linearly parametrize the model. From these, we retrieve a set of feasible link parameters (mass, position of center of mass, inertia) that is fundamental for more realistic dynamic simulations or when implementing in real time robot control laws using recursive Newton-Euler algorithms. The resulting problem is solved by means of an optimization method that incorporates constraints on the physical consistency of the dynamic parameters, including the triangle inequality of the link inertia tensors as well as other user-defined, possibly nonlinear constraints. The approach is developed for the increasingly popular Panda robot by Franka Emika, identifying for the first time its dynamic coefficients, an accurate joint friction model, and a set of feasible dynamic parameters. Validation of the identified dynamic model and of the retrieved feasible parameters is presented for the inverse dynamics problem using, respectively, a Lagrangian approach and Newton-Euler computations.

One of the expectations from fully-automated vehicles is never to cause an accident. However, an automated vehicle may not be able to avoid all collisions, e.g., the collisions caused by other road occupants. Hence, it is important for the system designers to understand the boundary case scenarios where an autonomous vehicle can no longer avoid a collision. In this paper, an automated test generation approach that utilizes Rapidly-exploring Random Trees is presented. A comparison of the proposed approach with an optimization-guided falsification approach from the literature is provided.

abstract = {In the near future mobile robots, such as personal robots or mobile manipulators, will share the workspace with other robots and humans. We present a method for mission and motion planning that applies to small teams of robots performing a task in an environment with moving obstacles, such as humans. Given a mission specification written in linear temporal logic, such as patrolling a set of rooms, we synthesize an automaton from which the robots can extract valid strategies. This centralized automaton is executed by the robots in the team at runtime, and in conjunction with a distributed motion planner that guarantees avoidance of moving obstacles. Our contribution is a correct-by-construction synthesis approach to multi-robot mission planning that guarantees collision avoidance with respect to moving obstacles, guarantees satisfaction of the mission specification and resolves encountered deadlocks, where a moving obstacle blocks the robot temporally. Our method provides conditions under which deadlock will be avoided by identifying environment behaviors that, when encountered at runtime, may prevent the robot team from achieving its goals. In particular, (1) it identifies deadlock conditions; (2) it is able to check whether they can be resolved; and (3) the robots implement the deadlock resolution policy locally in a distributed manner. The approach is capable of synthesizing and executing plans even with a high density of dynamic obstacles. In contrast to many existing approaches to mission and motion planning, it is scalable with the number of moving obstacles. We demonstrate the approach in physical experiments with walking humanoids moving in 2D environments and in simulation with aerial vehicles (quadrotors) navigating in 2D and 3D environments.},

abstract = {Despite the outstanding performances of sampling-based motion planning algorithms in different planning problems, they fail to operate in the presence of unknown obstacles. Even in few recent versions of these planners which has been upgraded to deal with unknown situations, the generated results are computationally expensive which creates a major problem in online implementations. Since the basic idea of randomized navigation algorithms is to utilize a pre-constructed structure of the obstacle map, the sampling procedure and the graph structure need to improve in order to deal with uncertainty in the planning space. In this paper, a self-adjusting probabilistic roadmap algorithm is proposed which deals with unknown obstacles quickly. This algorithm stores the generated samples in a grid structure based on their position in the corresponding configuration space which makes it computationally affordable to check them against collision later. It also enables the path planner to include safety as a decision factor during the actual navigation. Next, only the occupied grid cells by the undetected obstacles and their corresponding samples will be checked and the roadmap responses to the changes in the environment as soon as they occur. Furthermore, the size of the graph is maintained, and the occupied nodes are pushed away from the obstacle rather than being removed from the set of samples. Several simulation and comparative studies show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The planner has been also successfully implemented on a differential drive robotic platform in two navigation missions in unknown environments.},

Classical grid search is extended using subsampling for collision detection and also the dispersion-optimal Sukharev grid, which can be considered as a kind of lattice-based roadmap to complete the spectrum. Our experimental results show that the deterministic variants of the PRM offer performance advantages in comparison to the original, multiple-query PRM and the single-query, lazyPRM. Surprisingly, even some forms of grid search yield performance that is comparable to the original PRM. Our theoretical analysis shows that all of our deterministic PRM variants are resolution complete and achieve the best possible asymptotic convergence rate, which is shown to be superior to that obtained by random sampling. Thus, in surprising contrast to recent trends, there is both experimental and theoretical evidence that the randomization used in the original PRM is not advantageous.},

Due to factors like sensor noise or miscalibration, even if the free space is sufficient for the robot to pass through, it may not see enough clearance to navigate, hence limiting its operational space. An approach to facing this is to insert waypoints strategically placed within the problematic areas in the map, which are considered by the robot planner when generating a trajectory and help to successfully traverse them. This is typically carried out by a human operator either by relying on their experience or by trial-and-error. In this paper, we present an automatic procedure to perform this task that: (i) detects problematic areas in the map and (ii) generates a set of auxiliary navigation waypoints from which more suitable trajectories can be generated by the robot planner. Our proposal, fully compatible with the robotic operating system (ROS), has been successfully applied to robots deployed in different houses within the H2020 MoveCare project.

abstract = {To reduce data collection time for deep learning of robust robotic grasp plans, we explore training from a synthetic dataset of 6.7 million point clouds, grasps, and analytic grasp metrics generated from thousands of 3D models from Dex-Net 1.0 in randomized poses on a table. We use the resulting dataset, Dex-Net 2.0, to train a Grasp Quality Convolutional Neural Network (GQ-CNN) model that rapidly predicts the probability of success of grasps from depth images, where grasps are specified as the planar position, angle, and depth of a gripper relative to an RGB-D sensor. Experiments with over 1,000 trials on an ABB YuMi comparing grasp planning methods on singulated objects suggest that a GQ-CNN trained with only synthetic data from Dex-Net 2.0 can be used to plan grasps in 0.8s with a success rate of 93{\%} on eight known objects with adversarial geometry and is 3× faster than registering point clouds to a precomputed dataset of objects and indexing grasps. The Dex-Net 2.0 grasp planner also has the highest success rate on a dataset of 10 novel rigid objects and achieves 99{\%} precision (one false positive out of 69 grasps classified as robust) on a dataset of 40 novel household objects, some of which are articulated or deformable.},

This paper presents a whole-body control framework, inspired by legged bio-robots, for a velocity controlled non-holonomic mobile manipulator based on task priority. Control primitives, such as manipulability optimization, trajectory tracking of end-effector and mobile base, collision avoidance, et al. are considered in the framework and arranged at different priorities. Lower priority tasks are projected into the null space of control tasks with higher priorities. As a result, lower level tasks are completed without affecting the performance of higher priority tasks. Several experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The proposed method is proved to be an effective way to solve the whole-body control problem of velocity controlled mobile manipulators.},

Given a reference path and speed, our optimization-based receding-horizon approach computes a local trajectory that minimizes the tracking error while avoiding obstacles. We build on nonlinear model-predictive contouring control (MPCC) and extend it to incorporate a static map by computing, online, a set of convex regions in free space. We model moving obstacles as ellipsoids and provide a correct bound to approximate the collision region, given by the Minkowsky sum of an ellipse and a circle. Our framework is agnostic to the robot model. We present experimental results with a mobile robot navigating in indoor environments populated with humans. Our method is executed fully onboard without the need of external support and can be applied to other robot morphologies such as autonomous cars.},

The presented controller tries to follow the path while also avoiding dynamic/static objects it might encounter on the way. 
Objects are modelled by elipsoids and sphers. The controller can be mounted on the robot and reacts in real time, thus allowing autonomous behavior.

The proposed method, LMPCC, outperforms other local planners when used with dynamic and static objects. Used for mobile platforms and for lightly crowded environments. It also works for autonomous cars, which are more complex systems.

abstract = {Sampling-based motion planning is a powerful tool in solving the motion planning problem for a variety of different robotic platforms. As its application domains grow, more complicated planning problems arise that challenge the functionality of these planners. One of the main challenges in the implementation of a sampling-based planner is its weak performance when reacting to uncertainty in robot motion, obstacles motion, and sensing noise. In this paper, a multi-query sampling-based planner is presented based on the optimal probabilistic roadmaps algorithm that employs a hybrid sample classification and graph adjustment strategy to handle diverse types of planning uncertainty such as sensing noise, unknown static and dynamic obstacles and an inaccurate environment map in a discrete-time system. The proposed method starts by storing the collision-free generated samples in a matrix-grid structure. Using the resulting grid structure makes it computationally cheap to search and find samples in a specific region. As soon as the robot senses an obstacle during the execution of the initial plan, the occupied grid cells are detected, relevant samples are selected, and in-collision vertices are removed within the vision range of the robot. Furthermore, a second layer of nodes connected to the current direct neighbors are checked against collision, which gives the planner more time to react to uncertainty before getting too close to an obstacle. The simulation results for problems with various sources of uncertainty show a significant improvement compared with similar algorithms in terms of the failure rate, the processing time and the minimum distance from obstacles. The planner is also successfully implemented and tested on a TurtleBot in four different scenarios with uncertainty.},

First, we apply nonholonomic passive decomposition to split the kinematics of the two wheeled mobile robots into thegrasping/first-person view-centering behavior and the teleoperation-related behavior. We reveal that, under a mixed constraint of the system (i.e. physical/nonholonomic no-slip/drift constraint and artificial/holonomic grasping/first-person view-centering constraint), the first-person view camera cannot track an arbitrary human command. We then design the semi-autonomous control architecture, consisting of an autonomous grasping-enforcing and first-person view-centering control and a first-person view camera teleoperation control, which in turns stands upon autonomous human command tracking control. We also design visual and haptic feedback to notify the user of, and also nudge them to reduce, the command-behavior mismatch caused by the mixed constraint, which is difficult for the user to understand via the limited first-person view, we can thus induce user confusion/frustration and consequently performance deterioration. Experiment verification and a human subject study are performed to show the efficacy of our proposed first-person view semi-autonomous teleoperation framework with the visuo-haptic feedback.},

abstract = {Roadmaps constructed by many sampling-based motion planners coincide, in the absence of obstacles, with standard models of random geometric graphs (RGGs). Those models have been studied for several decades and by now a rich body of literature exists analyzing various properties and types of RGGs. In their seminal work on optimal motion planning, Karaman and Frazzoli conjectured that a sampling-based planner has a certain property if the underlying RGG has this property as well. In this paper, we settle this conjecture and leverage it for the development of a general framework for the analysis of sampling-based planners. Our framework, which we call localization–tessellation, allows for easy transfer of arguments on RGGs from the free unit hypercube to spaces punctured by obstacles, which are geometrically and topologically much more complex. We demonstrate its power by providing alternative and (arguably) simple proofs for probabilistic completeness and asymptotic (near-)optimality of probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs) in Euclidean spaces. Furthermore, we introduce three variants of PRMs, analyze them using our framework, and discuss the implications of the analysis.},

Hard-coding the motion, on the other hand, is infeasible since doors vary widely in their sizes and types, some doors are opened by pulling and others by pushing, and indoor spaces often contain obstacles that limit the freedom of the mobile manipulator and the degree to which the doors open up. In this paper, we show how to overcome the high-dimensionality of the planning problem by identifying a graph-based representation that is small enough for efficient planning yet rich enough to contain feasible motions that open doors. The use of graph search-based motion planning enables us to handle consistently the wide variance of conditions under which doors need to be open. We demonstrate our approach on the PR2 robot - a mobile manipulator with an omnidirectional base and a 7 degree of freedom arm. The robot was successful in opening a variety of doors both by pulling and pushing. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Skilled robotic manipulation benefits from complex synergies between non-prehensile (e.g. pushing) and prehensile (e.g. grasping) actions: pushing can help rearrange cluttered objects to make space for arms and fingers; likewise, grasping can help displace objects to make pushing movements more precise and collision-free. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to discover and learn these synergies from scratch through model-free deep reinforcement learning. Our method involves training two fully convolutional networks that map from visual observations to actions: one infers the utility of pushes for a dense pixel-wise sampling of end-effector orientations and locations, while the other does the same for grasping. Both networks are trained jointly in a Q-learning framework and are entirely self-supervised by trial and error, where rewards are provided from successful grasps. In this way, our policy learns pushing motions that enable future grasps, while learning grasps that can leverage past pushes. During picking experiments in both simulation and real-world scenarios, we find that our system quickly learns complex behaviors even amid challenging cases of tightly packed clutter, and achieves better grasping success rates and picking efficiencies than baseline alternatives after a few hours of training. We further demonstrate that our method is capable of generalizing to novel objects.

abstract = {One of the most general frameworks for phrasing control problems for complex, redundant robots is operational-space control. However, while this framework is of essential importance for robotics and well understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in the face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots (e.g. humanoid robots). In this paper, we suggest a learning approach for operational-space control as a direct inverse model learning problem. A first important insight for this paper is that a physically correct solution to the inverse problem with redundant degrees of freedom does exist when learning of the inverse map is performed in a suitable piecewise linear way. The second crucial component of our work is based on the insight that many operational-space controllers can be understood in terms of a constrained optimal control problem. The cost function associated with this optimal control problem allows us to formulate a learning algorithm that automatically synthesizes a globally consistent desired resolution of redundancy while learning the operational-space controller. From the machine learning point of view, this learning problem corresponds to a reinforcement learning problem that maximizes an immediate reward. We employ an expectation-maximization policy search algorithm in order to solve this problem. Evaluations on a three degrees-of-freedom robot arm are used to illustrate the suggested approach. The application to a physically realistic simulator of the anthropomorphic SARCOS Master arm demonstrates feasibility for complex high degree-of-freedom robots. We also show that the proposed method works in the setting of learning resolved motion rate control on a real, physical Mitsubishi PA-10 medical robotics arm.},

Where most work in the literature often provides models, sometimes simplified, of a given type of WMM, an extensive description of obtaining explicit kinematic and dynamic models of those systems is given. This modelling framework is particularly well suited for reactive control approaches, which, in the case of mobile manipulation missions, are often necessary to handle the complexity of the tasks to be fulfilled, the dynamic aspect of the extended workspace and the uncertainties on the knowledge of the environment. A flexible reactive framework is thus also provided, allowing the sequencing of operational tasks (in our case, tasks described in the end-effector frame) whose natures are different but also an on-line switching mechanism between constraints that are to be satisfied using the system redundancy. This framework has been successfully implemented in simulation and on a real robot. Some of the obtained results are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {For a robot to autonomously operate, it must have a method of planning its motion through its environment without the explicit guiding control of a human operator. In this paper, a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree search (RRT) algorithm was implemented to plan a collision-path for a mobile robot with a continuum arm. The RRT generated complete paths through various environments and was successfully able to connect the start configuration to the goal configuration using the robot's specific configuration space. Once the RRT completed, an A* search algorithm was run on the graph and the optimal path was found. This path, consisting of series of actions necessary for the robot to move from configuration to configuration, was then communicated to the robot using a local wireless network. The robot then executed the actions and moved through the environment. Due to errors in the robot's motion control, implemented with motor encoder feedback and a PID controller, the robot struggled to follow the path through the task space.

Classical path planning approaches often result in an over-constrained or overly cautious robot that fails to produce a feasible, safe path in the crowd, or plans a large, sub-optimal detour to avoid people in the scene. This work addresses these issues by exploiting long-term predictions of humans' activities to plan short and safe paths for mobile robots in social spaces. We introduce a Markov Decision Process based motion prediction approach, which extends the baseline works by better adapting online to the observation of the pedestrian speed (policy cutting technique) and by introducing a fast random-walk based method (stochastic policy sampling) to generate predictions. Moreover, differently from the baselines, we evaluate several ways to incorporate predictions in path planning algorithms, and choose the most promising one. Through an extensive evaluation, using both simulated and real-world datasets, we show that our approach can accurately predict human motion and improve the quality of robot's path planning.},

This article presents a new way of navigating in crowds by using behavioral clustering for the surrounding agents and representing the crowd as a set of moving polygons. Once the environment has been modelled in this way and the robot has all the information it needs, we then propose a navigation algorithm that is able to guide the vehicle through the scene. The key-points of this algorithm are that (1) it can avoid densely-populated areas in order to minimize the risk of being on a collision course with any of the surrounding dynamic obstacles, (2) it generates socially compliant trajectories.},

The approach taking starts with a globally planned trajectory to a destination. If there is any collision on the path, state candidates around the possible collision point are generated. Each of them is then checked for collision. This is the basic idea behind the effective avoidance combination strategy (EACS). However, the paths are only short lasting since no uncertainty in the agents movement is considered. The proposed method uses ideas of group-forming behaviors in crowds, i.e. humans tend to form groups that follow the same direction when being in crowds. Thus, a clustering to polygons is done. The groups are treated as entities subsequently.

A probabilistic model of the environment is formulated, under which recursive Bayesian filters are used to estimate the environment events and hazards online. The robots must control their positions both to avoid sensor failures and to provide useful sensor information by following the analytical gradient of mutual information computed using these online estimates. Mutual information is shown to combine the competing incentives of avoiding failure and collecting informative measurements under a common objective. Simulations demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.},

Humans concurrently aid and comply with each other while moving in a shared space. Cooperation helps pedestrians to efficiently reach their own goals and respect conventions such as the personal space of others. To meet human comparable efficiency, a robot needs to predict the human trajectories and plan its own trajectory correspondingly in the same shared space. In this work, we present a navigation planner that is able to plan such cooperative trajectories, simultaneously enforcing the robot's kinematic constraints and avoiding other non-human dynamic obstacles. Using robust social constraints of projected time to a possible future collision, compatibility of human-robot motion direction, and proxemics, our planner is able to replicate human-like navigation behavior not only in open spaces but also in confined areas. Besides adapting the robot trajectory, the planner is also able to proactively propose co-navigation solutions by jointly computing human and robot trajectories within the same optimization framework. We demonstrate richness and performance of the cooperative planner with simulated and real world experiments on multiple interactive navigation scenarios.},

It does not take any dynamic constraints of the underlying robot into account directly. This contribution introduces a new approach called "timed elastic band" which explicitly considers temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The "timed elastic band" problem is formulated in a weighted multi-objective optimization framework. Most objectives are local as they depend on a few neighboring intermediate configurations. This results in a sparse system matrix for which efficient large-scale constrained least squares optimization methods exist. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the approach is robust and computationally efficient to generate optimal robot trajectories in real time. The "timed elastic band" converts an initial path composed of a sequence of way points into a trajectory with explicit dependence on time which enables the control of the robot in real time. Due to its modular formulation the approach is easily extended to incorporate additional objectives and constraints.},

abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical, to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new methods, STABLE-SPARSE-RRT (SST) and SST∗, result from this analysis, which are asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots.},

We can plan pose-to-pose trajectories from most configurations with only a couple (one to two) hybrid switches and in reasonable time (one to five seconds).

abstract = {In a future intelligent factory, a robotic manipulator must work efficiently and safely in a Human–Robot collaborative and dynamic unstructured environment. Autonomous path planning is the most important issue which must be resolved first in the process of improving robotic manipulator intelligence. Among the path-planning methods, the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm based on random sampling has been widely applied in dynamic path planning for a high-dimensional robotic manipulator, especially in a complex environment because of its probability completeness, perfect expansion, and fast exploring speed over other planning methods. However, the existing RRT algorithm has a limitation in path planning for a robotic manipulator in a dynamic unstructured environment. Therefore, an autonomous obstacle avoidance dynamic path-planning method for a robotic manipulator based on an improved RRT algorithm, called Smoothly RRT (S-RRT), is proposed. This method that targets a directional node extends and can increase the sampling speed and efficiency of RRT dramatically. A path optimization strategy based on the maximum curvature constraint is presented to generate a smooth and curved continuous executable path for a robotic manipulator. Finally, the correctness, effectiveness, and practicability of the proposed method are demonstrated and validated via a MATLAB static simulation and a Robot Operating System (ROS) dynamic simulation environment as well as a real autonomous obstacle avoidance experiment in a dynamic unstructured environment for a robotic manipulator. The proposed method not only provides great practical engineering significance for a robotic manipulator's obstacle avoidance in an intelligent factory, but also theoretical reference value for other type of robots' path planning.},

abstract = {Coordinates play an essential role in the description of real world objects and physical processes. In robotics, coordinates are used to describe the kinematic structure and the kinematic and dynamic behavior. The description mostly takes place in charts, assigned by the observer of the robotic system. However, it is crucial that the described physical process does not depend on the coordinate choice of the observer. In this work we show the relation between coordinates and manipulability analysis. Manipulability measures are dependent of joint coordinates of the robot and task coordinates in the workspace of the robot. Both relations can be analyzed with tensor geometry. We remove the dependency on joint coordinates through the use of an appropriate metric. With the help of tensor contraction, the resulting induced metric in the workspace can be transformed into a coordinate invariant matrix. After applying eigenvalue decomposition on this matrix, we can visualize the dynamic manipulability of a robot as a coordinate invariant ellipsoid.},

Recent works present deep reinforcement learning as a framework to model the complex interactions and cooperation. However, they are implemented using key assumptions about other agents' behavior that deviate from reality as the number of agents in the environment increases. This work extends our previous approach to develop an algorithm that learns collision avoidance among a variety of types of dynamic agents without assuming they follow any particular behavior rules. This work also introduces a strategy using LSTM that enables the algorithm to use observations of an arbitrary number of other agents, instead of previous methods that have a fixed observation size.

abstract = {We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear dynamics. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots [10], by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on RRT* for kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The proposed approach is equally applicable to nonholonomic mobile robots such as rover-mounted manipulators and holonomic mobile robots such as tracked robots and compound manipulators. For wheeled mobile robots, the nonholonomic base constraints are incorporated directly into the task formulation as kinematic constraints. The configuration control approach is extended to exploit the redundancy introduced by the base mobility to perform a set of user-specified additional tasks during the end-effector motion while satisfying the nonholonomic base constraints (if applicable). This approach treats the base nonholonomy and the kinematic redundancy in a unified manner to formulate new task constraints. The computational efficiency of the proposed control scheme makes it particularly suitable for real-time implementation. Two simulation studies are presented to demonstrate the applications of the motion control scheme to a rover-mounted arm (non-holonomic system) and to a tracked robot (holonomic system).},

Estimation and planning problems are usually considered separately, however, within our framework we show that solving them simultaneously can be more accurate and efficient. The key idea is to compute the full continuous-time trajectory from start to goal at each time-step. While the robot traverses the trajectory, the history portion of the trajectory signifies the solution to the estimation problem, and the future portion of the trajectory signifies a solution to the planning problem. Building on recent probabilistic inference approaches to continuous-time localization and mapping and continuous-time motion planning, we solve the joint problem by iteratively recomputing the maximum a posteriori trajectory conditioned on all available sensor data and cost information. Our approach can contend with high-degree-of-freedom trajectory spaces, uncertainty due to limited sensing capabilities, model inaccuracy, the stochastic effect of executing actions, and can find a solution in real-time. We evaluate our framework empirically in both simulation and on a mobile manipulator.},

abstract = {Mobile robots are increasingly populating our human environments. To interact with humans in a socially compliant way, these robots need to understand and comply with mutually accepted rules. In this paper, we present a novel approach to model the cooperative navigation behavior of humans. We model their behavior in terms of a mixture distribution that captures both the discrete navigation decisions, such as going left or going right, as well as the natural variance of human trajectories. Our approach learns the model parameters of this distribution that match, in expectation, the observed behavior in terms of user-defined features. To compute the feature expectations over the resulting high-dimensional continuous distributions, we use Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Furthermore, we rely on a Voronoi graph of the environment to efficiently explore the space of trajectories from the robot's current position to its target position. Using the proposed model, our method is able to imitate the behavior of pedestrians or, alternatively, to replicate a specific behavior that was taught by tele-operation in the target environment of the robot. We implemented our approach on a real mobile robot and demonstrated that it is able to successfully navigate in an office environment in the presence of humans. An extensive set of experiments suggests that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods to model the behavior of pedestrians, which also makes it applicable to fields such as behavioral science or computer graphics.},

abstract = {The motion of a mechanical system can be defined as a path through its configuration space. Computing such a path has a computational complexity scaling exponentially with the dimensionality of the configuration space. We propose to reduce the dimensionality of the configuration space by introducing the irreducible path — a path having a minimal swept volume. The paper consists of three parts: In part I, we define the space of all irreducible paths and show that planning a path in the irreducible path space preserves completeness of any motion planning algorithm. In part II, we construct an approximation to the irreducible path space of a serial kinematic chain under certain assumptions. In part III, we conduct motion planning using the irreducible path space for a mechanical snake in a turbine environment, for a mechanical octopus with eight arms in a pipe system and for the sideways motion of a humanoid robot moving through a room with doors and through a hole in a wall. We demonstrate that the concept of an irreducible path can be applied to any motion planning algorithm taking curvature constraints into account.},

The full space of continous paths is replaced by the irreducible paths space which preserves its completeness. An irreducible path is basically the best path between two configurations. No objects are considered in this paper. 
In case of snake-like robots, this results in a simplified motion planner. Only the first link, the root link, must be planned as the following links, the sub-links, only follow the root. Therefore, they are in the shadow of the root. So they do not create new 'swept volume'. In case of a sideways moving humanoid robot, the arms could be considered as sub links whereas the main body is the root link. It seems really specific to certain problems, such as snake-like robots or sideways-moving humanoids.},

If a valid path for the robot correlates to a path in the workspace, then the planning process can employ a representation of the workspace that captures its salient topological features. Prior approaches have investigated exploiting geometric decompositions of the workspace to bias sampling; while beneficial in some environments, complex narrow passages remain challenging to navigate. In this work, we present Dynamic Region-biased RRT, a novel sampling-based planner that guides the exploration of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) by moving sampling regions along an embedded graph that captures the workspace topology. These sampling regions are dynamically created, manipulated, and destroyed to greedily bias sampling through unexplored passages that lead to the goal.

In this paper, we introduce a parallel autonomy, or shared control, framework that computes safe trajectories for an automated vehicle, based on human inputs. We minimize the deviation from the human inputs while ensuring safety via a set of collision avoidance constraints. Our method achieves safe motion even in complex driving scenarios, such as those commonly encountered in an urban setting. We introduce a receding horizon planner formulated as nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which includes the analytic descriptions of road boundaries and the configuration and future uncertainties of other road participants. The NMPC operates over both steering and acceleration simultaneously. We introduce a nonslip model suitable for handling complex environments with dynamic obstacles, and a nonlinear combined slip vehicle model including normal load transfer capable of handling static environments. We validate the proposed approach in two complex driving scenarios. First, in an urban environment that includes a left-turn across traffic and passing on a busy street. And second, under snow conditions on a race track with sharp turns and under complex dynamic constraints. We evaluate the performance of the method with various human driving styles.

A novel motion model provides the basis to predict, plan and coordinate agent trajectories in intersection scenarios. The approach establishes an implicit, non-overt cooperation between the robot and humans by linking the prediction and planning of agent trajectories within a unified representation in terms of timed elastic bands. The planning process maintains multiple topological alternatives to resolve the encounter in a manner compliant with the implicit rules and objectives of human proxemics. The trajectory is obtained by optimizing the timed elastic band considering multiple conflicting objectives such as fastest path and minimal spatial separation among agents but also global proxemic aspects such as motion coherence within a group. Cooperation is achieved by coupling predicted and planned agent trajectories to eventually reach an implicit agreement of the agents on how to circumnavigate each other. The parameters of the cost functions of the underlying motion model are identified by inverse optimal control from a dataset of 73 recorded encounters with up to five humans and a total of 283 individual trajectories.

Next, the sampling-based planners provide roadmaps which connect robot configurations that can be successfully navigated by the RL agent. The same RL agents are used to control the robot under the direction of the planning, enabling long-range navigation. We use the Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) for the sampling-based planner.

Our results show improvement in task completion over both RL agents on their own and traditional sampling-based planners.

While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A simple and efficient randomized algorithm is presented for solving single-query path planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The method works by incrementally building two Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is also presented.},

abstract = {Probabilistic Roadmaps are increasingly being used for robot motion planning. The method makes use of an offline construction of a roadmap. Even though the method is offline, it needs to be initially constructed as quickly as possible for an efficient and near-real time initial motion of the robot. The challenge lies in sampling of multiple narrow corridors wherein the probability of samples is very low. It is important to discover all homotopic groups very early to make good initial decisions from the roadmap. Missing out of even a single homotopic group can lead to no solution or poor solutions. The proposed method uses a multi-strategized approach for sampling of the initial points and then intelligently constructs edges between the points in a multi-strategized manner. The aim is to increase sampling at the narrow corridors and then to facilitate edge connectivity of nodes inside the corridor with the rest of the roadmap, so as to lead to the discovery of all possible homotopic groups between any pair of sources and goals. The approach results in a better performance as compared to uniform sampling and obstacle based sampling.},

2) Gaussian sampling : Increasing probablity for sampling close to obstacles
3) Bridge-test : Testing close samples in both directions for each sample. If both lay inside an obstacle it is said to be in a narrow-passage

Contribution : Addressing narrow passages

The method is based on three different sampling strategies :
1) Bridge-test based to detect narrow passages
2) obstacle based to sample around obstacles
3) Uniform sampling to cover the remaining configuration space},

Many applications on the rise need accurate and efficient segmentation mechanisms: autonomous driving, indoor navigation, and even virtual or augmented reality systems to name a few. This demand coincides with the rise of deep learning approaches in almost every field or application target related to computer vision, including semantic segmentation or scene understanding. This paper provides a review on deep learning methods for semantic segmentation applied to various application areas. Firstly, we describe the terminology of this field as well as mandatory background concepts. Next, the main datasets and challenges are exposed to help researchers decide which are the ones that best suit their needs and their targets. Then, existing methods are reviewed, highlighting their contributions and their significance in the field. Finally, quantitative results are given for the described methods and the datasets in which they were evaluated, following up with a discussion of the results. At last, we point out a set of promising future works and draw our own conclusions about the state of the art of semantic segmentation using deep learning techniques.},

Safety legislations require no-fly zones near crowded areas that can be indicated by semantic annotations on a geometric map. This work proposes an automatic annotation of 3D maps with crowded areas, by projecting 2D annotations that are derived through visual analysis of UAV video frames. To this aim, a fully convolutional neural network is proposed, in order to comply with the computational restrictions of the application, that can effectively distinguish between crowded and non-crowded scenes based on a regularized multiple-loss training method, and provide semantic heatmaps that are projected on the 3D occupancy grid of Octomap. The projection is based on raycasting and leads to polygonal areas that are geo-localized on the map and could be exported in KML format. Initial qualitative evaluation using both synthetic and real world drone scenes, proves the applicability of the method.},

To achieve autonomous capability, a well-behave navigation system is required. Currently, there are many different kinds of path planning methods, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

In this approach, the indoor environment is identified with the use of RGBD SLAM algorithm and a cloud point map is generated. Then the point cloud map is converted to Octo-map that can be used to create occupancy grid map. In the end, a collision-free path is produced for mobile robot based on modified PRM algorithm. The experiments are conducted with robot operating system (ROS), mobile robot and Kinect v2.

In this paper, and considering data from a 3D-LIDAR mounted onboard an intelligent vehicle, a 3D perception system based on voxels and planes is proposed for ground modeling and obstacle detection in urban environments. The system, which incorporates time-dependent data, is composed of two main modules: (i) an effective ground surface estimation using a piecewise plane fitting algorithm and RANSAC-method, and (ii) a voxel-grid model for static and moving obstacles detection using discriminative analysis and ego-motion information. This perception system has direct application in safety systems for intelligent vehicles, particularly in collision avoidance and vulnerable road users detection, namely pedestrians and cyclists. Experiments, using point-cloud data from a Velodyne LIDAR and localization data from an Inertial Navigation System were conducted for both a quantitative and a qualitative assessment of the static/moving obstacle detection module and for the surface estimation approach. Reported results, from experiments using the KITTI database, demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach in urban scenarios.},
