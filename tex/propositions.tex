\begin{enumerate}

  \item Safety in the sense of collision avoidance is inherently in conflict
    with fast robotic manipulation. (This thesis)
  \item In robotics, robustness is more valuable than optimality and formal
    guarantees. (This thesis)
  \item Optimization fabrics create human-like motions. (This thesis)
  \item Warranties on collision avoidance in dynamic environments are not
    realistic, striving for it is thus pointless (This thesis).
  %\item Engineering sciences should embrace failure.
  %\item Perception is inaccurate, so the paradigm, sense-plan-act, is prone to
  %  fail.
  \item Academic publications in robotics are of little use for advancing the
    field without proper software releases.
  %\item In software engineering, comments are a manifestation of failure.
  \item Major engineering advancements are unlikely to come from academic
    institutions, but rather from companies.
  \item Effective peer-reviewing requires a measurable reward systems.
  \item Individual career goals harm collaborative research efforts.
  %\item Humans quickly get used to a comfort in a way that its removal becomes
    %politically impossible.
  \item Effective action to combat climate change requires major natural disaster
    for society to understand the urgency.
  %\item Advancement in an academic career progressively requires more management
    %skills, while these skills are not encouraged in the promotion process.
  \item The older a democracy is, the more socially
    segmented its society becomes.
  %\item As democracies age, their societies tend to become more divided into different social groups
  %\item The source of a figure holds more information than the figure.
