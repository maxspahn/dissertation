In this experiment, we show qualitatively how \ac{df} could be used in
collaborative environments where humans and robots coexist. For this
experiment, we give the robot a static goal pose similar to a pickup setup. The
same environment is shared with a co-worker who restocks a shelf. The right
hand of the human is tracked with a motion capture system.
The hand is then avoided by the robot using \ac{df}, see
\changed{\cref{fig:experiment6_realPanda}}. In this experiment, the minimum distance
between the robot and the hand was $0.062$m. This real-world experiment
showcases potential applications of the proposed method.
