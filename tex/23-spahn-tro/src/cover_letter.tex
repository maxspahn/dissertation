Dear Editor,

We would like to submit the manuscript entitled "Dynamic Optimization Fabrics
for Motion Generation" by Max Spahn, Martijn Wisse and Javier Alonso-Mora to be
considered for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics. The work is
original and has not been published elsewhere nor is it currently under
consideration for publication elsewhere.

We present dynamic fabrics as a highly reactive trajectory generation method
for various types of robots. The method is rooted in geometric control and
inspired by the results on Riemannanian Motion Policies. We believe that
our extension to nonholonomic mobile manipulators simplifies the connection
between the two subsystems a mobile manipulator is composed of.

We have had no previous contact with the journal regarding this submission. The
authors have no conflict of interest to declare. All authors have approved the
manuscript and agree with its submission to the journal.

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript.

Sincerely,

Max Spahn, corresponding author.
